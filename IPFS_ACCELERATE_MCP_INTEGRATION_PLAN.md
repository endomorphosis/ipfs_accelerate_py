# IPFS Accelerate MCP Integration Plan

This document outlines the plan for integrating the Model Context Protocol (MCP) with IPFS Accelerate.

## Goals

The primary goals of the MCP integration are:

1. Enable Large Language Models (LLMs) to interact with IPFS functionality through a standardized API
2. Provide access to hardware acceleration capabilities for AI models
3. Create a modular and extensible architecture for future enhancements
4. Support development and testing through mock implementations
5. Integrate seamlessly with the existing IPFS Accelerate codebase

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Completed)

- Create the basic MCP server structure
- Implement mock implementations for development without dependencies
- Set up the type system and shared context
- Implement sample tools for file operations

### Phase 2: Tool Implementation

- Implement remaining IPFS file operation tools
- Implement IPFS network operation tools
- Implement model acceleration tools
- Connect to existing hardware detection and acceleration functionality
- Add Filecoin integration tools

### Phase 3: Integration with IPFS Accelerate

- Update setup.py to include MCP as an optional component
- Create installation documentation
- Integrate with existing WebNN and WebGPU acceleration
- Configure system to automatically start MCP server when needed
- Add MCP configuration options to main IPFS Accelerate configuration

### Phase 4: Testing and Documentation

- Comprehensive unit testing
- Integration testing with real IPFS and hardware
- Performance testing with large models and datasets
- Example integration with popular LLM systems
- Detailed API documentation for LLM usage
- Developer documentation for extending the MCP server

### Phase 5: Deployment and Monitoring

- Packaging for distribution
- Monitoring and logging infrastructure
- Error reporting and analysis
- Usage statistics and analytics
- Performance optimization

## Technical Considerations

### Dependency Management

The MCP integration handles dependencies that may or may not be available:

- **FastMCP**: Falls back to mock implementation when not available
- **ipfs-kit-py**: Falls back to mock IPFS client when not available
- **Hardware Acceleration**: Gracefully degrades when specific hardware is not available

### Performance Considerations

- Optimize for low latency in tool execution
- Use asynchronous I/O to improve throughput
- Cache frequent operations to reduce IPFS network load
- Implement progress reporting for long-running operations
- Consider streaming responses for large content

### Security Considerations

- Validate all input parameters to prevent injection attacks
- Implement access controls for sensitive operations
- Sandbox model execution to prevent resource abuse
- Limit resource usage for model acceleration
- Implement secure credential handling for IPFS and Filecoin operations

## Integration with Existing Code

The MCP server will integrate with existing IPFS Accelerate components:

1. **hardware_detection.py**: Use for hardware capability detection
2. **webgpu_platform.py**, **webnn_webgpu.py**: Leverage for model acceleration
3. **ipfs_accelerate_py.py**: Main functionality to expose through MCP
4. **benchmarks/**: Utilize for performance testing and optimization

## Milestones and Timeline

1. **Core Infrastructure**: Initial implementation of MCP server and basic tools (Completed)
2. **Tool Implementation**: Comprehensive set of tools for IPFS and acceleration (2 weeks)
3. **Integration**: Connect with existing IPFS Accelerate functionality (2 weeks)
4. **Testing and Documentation**: Comprehensive testing and documentation (2 weeks)
5. **Deployment**: Packaging and distribution (1 week)

## Future Extensions

1. **Advanced Acceleration Techniques**: Integration with new hardware acceleration methods
2. **Distributed Computing**: Support for distributed model execution
3. **Federated Learning**: Tools for privacy-preserving federated learning
4. **Content-Addressed Models**: Version-controlled model storage and retrieval
5. **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: Support for multi-agent systems using IPFS for coordination

## Conclusion

The MCP integration will significantly enhance the capabilities of IPFS Accelerate by providing a standardized interface for LLMs to interact with IPFS and hardware acceleration functionality. The modular design and gradual implementation plan ensure that the integration can be developed, tested, and deployed in a systematic manner.
