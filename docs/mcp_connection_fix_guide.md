# IPFS Accelerate MCP Connection Fix Guide

This guide explains how to fix the connection issues between Claude and the IPFS Accelerate MCP server.

## Problem Identified

After inspecting the MCP server implementation and testing its functionality, we identified several issues preventing proper connection between Claude and the IPFS Accelerate MCP server:

1. **Non-standard MCP Implementation**: 
   - The existing server lacks the standard `/mcp/manifest` endpoint required by the MCP protocol
   - The SSE implementation doesn't properly handle bidirectional communication

2. **Missing Protocol Support**:
   - The server doesn't properly implement the MCP protocol for tool calls via SSE
   - There's no mechanism to handle client requests over the SSE connection

3. **Incomplete SSE Implementation**:
   - The current implementation only sends "init" and "heartbeat" events
   - It doesn't process incoming requests from clients

## Solution Implemented

We've created an enhanced MCP server (`enhanced_mcp_server.py`) that properly implements the MCP protocol:

1. **Standard MCP Endpoints**:
   - Added a `/mcp/manifest` endpoint that returns detailed tool schemas
   - Implemented proper SSE endpoint with bidirectional communication

2. **Improved Client Management**:
   - Added a `ClientManager` class to handle client connections
   - Implemented proper message queuing for each client

3. **Tool Schema Definitions**:
   - Added detailed schema definitions for each tool
   - Ensured proper parameter validation and error handling

4. **Bidirectional Communication**:
   - Added support for receiving tool call requests via HTTP
   - Implemented response delivery through the SSE connection

## How to Use the Enhanced Server

1. **Start the Enhanced Server**:
   ```bash
   ./run_enhanced_mcp_server.sh
   ```

2. **Verify the Server**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:8002/tools
   curl http://localhost:8002/mcp/manifest
   ```

3. **Update Claude's MCP Settings**:
   - Ensure the MCP settings file has the correct configuration:
   ```json
   "ipfs-accelerate-mcp": {
     "disabled": false,
     "timeout": 60,
     "url": "http://localhost:8002/sse",
     "transportType": "sse"
   }
   ```

4. **Restart VSCode and Claude**:
   - Close VSCode completely
   - Restart VSCode
   - Reload the Claude extension (Ctrl+Shift+P, then "Developer: Reload Window")

5. **Test the Connection**:
   - Start a new conversation with Claude
   - Test the connection with:
   ```
   use_mcp_tool with server_name='ipfs-accelerate-mcp', tool_name='health_check', arguments={}
   ```

## Key Improvements

1. **Standards Compliance**:
   - The enhanced server follows the MCP protocol specification
   - It provides proper schema information for tools

2. **Robust Client Handling**:
   - Each client gets a dedicated message queue
   - Proper cleanup when clients disconnect

3. **Better Error Handling**:
   - Detailed error messages for tool calls
   - Proper validation of parameters

4. **Maintainable Architecture**:
   - Clean separation of concerns
   - Well-documented code

## Troubleshooting

### ✅ ISSUE RESOLVED

**Status**: All major MCP server connection issues have been successfully resolved as of May 29, 2025.

**Root Cause**: Missing JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol support, specifically the `tools/list` method handler.

**Resolution**: Complete JSON-RPC 2.0 implementation added to `final_mcp_server.py` with all required MCP methods.

### Current Server Status

The MCP server is now fully operational with:
- ✅ JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol support
- ✅ All 8 tools properly registered and accessible
- ✅ VS Code MCP extension compatibility
- ✅ Port 8004 configuration (matching client expectations)

### Quick Verification

Test the server is working:

```bash
# Test ping
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"ping","id":1}' \
  http://127.0.0.1:8004/jsonrpc

# List tools
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"tools/list","id":2}' \
  http://127.0.0.1:8004/jsonrpc
```

### Legacy Troubleshooting (No Longer Needed)

The following issues have been permanently resolved:
- ❌ ~~Connection timeouts~~ → ✅ JSON-RPC protocol implemented
- ❌ ~~Missing tools/list method~~ → ✅ Method properly implemented
- ❌ ~~VS Code extension failures~~ → ✅ Full compatibility confirmed
- ❌ ~~Tool registration issues~~ → ✅ All 8 tools registered

### Minor Issues (If Any)

If you still experience any minor issues:

1. **Check Server Process**:
   ```bash
   ps aux | grep final_mcp_server.py
   ```

2. **Verify Port Availability**:
   ```bash
   netstat -tlnp | grep 8004
   ```

3. **Check Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip list | grep -E "(fastapi|uvicorn|pydantic)"
   ```

4. **Restart Server**:
   ```bash
   pkill -f final_mcp_server.py
   python final_mcp_server.py --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8004 --debug
   ```
