# IPFS Accelerate MCP Server Assessment

## Executive Summary

This assessment evaluates the functionality and tool coverage of the IPFS Accelerate MCP (Model Context Protocol) server. We discovered multiple server instances running with different levels of functionality and tool coverage. The best-performing instance has 84.21% coverage of the expected tools, with only 3 out of 19 expected tools missing.

## Server Instances

| Server | Port | Host | Tool Count | Coverage |
|--------|------|------|------------|----------|
| direct_mcp_server.py | 3000 | default | 5 | 26.32% |
| direct_mcp_server.py | 8001 | 127.0.0.1 | 16 | 84.21% |

## Tool Coverage Analysis

### Available and Working Tools (Port 8001)

The server on port 8001 exposes and successfully handles requests for the following tools:

1. **IPFS Tools**:
   - `ipfs_add_file`: Add a file to IPFS
   - `ipfs_cat`: Retrieve content from IPFS by CID
   - `ipfs_files_write`: Write content to IPFS MFS (Mutable File System)
   - `ipfs_files_read`: Read content from IPFS MFS

2. **Hardware Tools**:
   - `get_hardware_info`: Get hardware information about the system

3. **Model Management Tools**:
   - `list_models`: List available models
   - `create_endpoint`: Create a model endpoint for inference
   - `run_inference`: Run inference on a model endpoint

4. **API Multiplexing Tools**:
   - `register_api_key`: Register an API key for the multiplexer
   - `get_api_keys`: Get information about registered API keys
   - `get_multiplexer_stats`: Get statistics about the API multiplexer
   - `simulate_api_request`: Simulate an API request through the multiplexer

5. **Task Management Tools**:
   - `start_task`: Start a background task
   - `get_task_status`: Get status of a background task
   - `list_tasks`: List active and completed tasks

6. **System Tools**:
   - `health_check`: Check server health status

### Missing Tools (Port 8001)

The server is missing the following tools that are defined in `direct_mcp_server.py`:

1. **Hardware Tools**:
   - `get_hardware_capabilities`: Get detailed hardware capabilities

2. **Advanced Tools**:
   - `throughput_benchmark`: Run throughput benchmarks for models
   - `quantize_model`: Quantize a model to reduce size

### Limited Server (Port 3000)

The server on port 3000 only exposes the following tools:
- `health_check`
- `ipfs_add_file`
- `ipfs_cat`
- `ipfs_files_read`
- `ipfs_files_write`

## Implementation Details

1. **Server Implementation**: The MCP server is implemented in `direct_mcp_server.py`, which defines all expected tools and their handlers.

2. **Tool Registration**: The `register_mcp_tools.py` script appears to handle the registration of tools with the MCP server. This script may not be registering all tools defined in `direct_mcp_server.py`.

3. **Server Startup**: The `restart_mcp_server.sh` script shows that it runs `mcp.run_server` with a default port of 8002, but the running instances use `direct_mcp_server.py` on ports 3000 and 8001.

## Recommendations

1. **Standardize Server Configuration**:
   - Use a single server implementation with consistent tool registration
   - Ensure all expected tools are registered and available

2. **Implement Missing Tools**:
   - Add the missing `get_hardware_capabilities` tool
   - Add the missing `throughput_benchmark` tool
   - Add the missing `quantize_model` tool

3. **Server Monitoring**:
   - Implement regular monitoring of tool availability
   - Create alerts for when tools become unavailable

4. **Documentation Improvements**:
   - Document all available tools and their functionality
   - Include examples of how to use each tool
   - Provide troubleshooting guides for common issues

## Conclusion

The IPFS Accelerate MCP server implementation is mostly complete with 84.21% coverage on the best-performing instance. By implementing the missing tools and standardizing the server configuration, the MCP server can reach 100% coverage and provide a complete API for interacting with IPFS and related functionality.
