# Development History Documentation

This directory contains historical documentation files generated during the development and integration phases of the IPFS Accelerate project.

## Purpose

These files document major milestones and phase completions throughout the project's development lifecycle:
- Integration test results and verification steps
- Code review findings and fixes
- Security audits and summaries
- Phase completion summaries
- Development milestones and achievements

- **TRUE_100_PERCENT_COVERAGE.md** - Full test coverage achievement
- **COMPLETE_API_INTEGRATION_VERIFICATION.md** - API integration validation
- **COMPREHENSIVE_FINAL_VERIFICATION.md** - Final system-wide verification

### Phase Completions
- **PHASE1_INTEGRATION_COMPLETE.md** - Phase 1 integration milestone
- **PHASE2_COMPLETE_SUMMARY.md** - Phase 2 completion summary
- **BATCH_4_5_6_INTEGRATION_COMPLETE.md** - Multiple batch integrations

### Feature-Specific Histories

## Organization

Documents are organized by:
1. **Type**: Verification, Integration, Summary
2. **Scope**: Phase-level, Feature-specific, System-wide
3. **Timeline**: Generally chronological within categories

## Usage

These files are **reference documentation only** and document the development process. They are:
- **Not required** for building, testing, or using the IPFS Accelerate package
- **Historical records** of completed work
- **Not actively maintained** - see current docs for latest information
- **Preserved** for project continuity and knowledge transfer

For current, actively maintained documentation, see:
- **Main Documentation**: [../README.md](../README.md)
- **Architecture**: [../ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md)
- **API Reference**: [../API.md](../API.md)
- **Testing Guide**: [../TESTING.md](../TESTING.md)
