# Reduce complete supervisor tokens with native metadata and checked capsules

The objective is fewer total input and output tokens over the entire Terminal
Bench supervisor run, while retaining the planning session and `llm_router`.
Database metadata should let the supervisor reuse established facts, formal
results should identify which obligations remain, and semantic capsules should
give the model the relevant current evidence without repeating its bookkeeping.
Minification is a representation step within that workflow.

The [qualified prior comparison](evidence/terminal-reply-contract-pair-20261007/README.md)
used 246,992 baseline tokens and 327,117 compact-transport tokens. Compact used
80,125 more tokens (32.44%), despite a smaller initial coding input. Coding
accounted for 89.78% of baseline tokens. These observations prioritize coding
context and complete session accounting; they do not establish a causal effect
from one pair. General planning remains enabled.

## Assign each component a precise responsibility

| Component | Role in reducing repeated work | Required boundary |
| --- | --- | --- |
| DuckDB | Store current task/dependency/evidence indexes, accepted native records and capsule locators | A locator or timestamp does not establish source freshness |
| Quack | Read state through the authenticated current native owner | Use a qualified typed operation; the generic gateway remains unqualified |
| DuckLake | Retain observational history for revision/delta comparisons and experiment accounting | Historical facts need current task/source checks before operational reuse |
| Formal systems | Reuse checked receipts and determine remaining supported obligations | Revalidate source, dependencies and assumptions; retain all six native verdicts |
| Semantic capsules | Present current task-specific evidence and residual work compactly | Required code, constraints, scope and uncertainty must remain available |
| Minification | Share identical metadata or encode exact reversible representations | Verify restoration; input bytes are not total provider tokens |
| Embeddings/autoencoders | Rank relevant facts, operators and capsules | Similarity does not authorize omission, proof, execution or completion |

The existing 8D spaCy, 384D and 768D GTE paths can rank metadata and capsules.
A Leanstral hidden-layer representation can be evaluated for that role. The
existing comparison already reused initial indexes with zero new embedding
calls; a new treatment cannot claim to eliminate those already absent calls.
Record inference, refresh and training separately from native LLM tokens.
Reuse the retained embeddings and checkpoints in their existing namespaces:
IR family, schema/version, decoder task, dimension and token profile. LegalIR,
SecurityIR, CodebaseIR and IntentIR remain separate; 8D, 384D and 768D ranking
paths can run in parallel. Their encoder token windows do not identify the
coding provider's tokenizer. This metadata measurement change creates no new
checkpoint, embedding or database owner.

## First implemented treatment: readable shared metadata

The largest identical measured component in the prior pair was the semantic
context, 31,939 bytes. Retrieval was 4,832 bytes and the Doctor advisory was
2,109 bytes. The Doctor receipts do not expose row-sharing counts, so successor
counts cannot establish the benefit of factoring its rows. The first treatment
therefore operates on the verified semantic context.

[`semantic_metadata_view.py`](../../ipfs_accelerate_py/agent_supervisor/runtime/semantic_metadata_view.py)
adds the opt-in `common-bindings@1` view. It factors exact identical schema,
version and source-binding metadata into named **inline** common fields for
capsule/admission rows. The original native dictionary remains visible.
It preserves source text, paths, signatures, unknown fields, native core,
requirements, authority, verdicts and suffixes. It reconstructs the complete
original `@1` representation exactly. It refuses the previous `@2` treatment
so the two experiments are not mixed.

The runner constructs both complete coding inputs with the same workspace,
Doctor advisory, public instruction and coding reply instruction. It selects
the view only if the final input is strictly smaller in bytes and under the
explicit `utf8-bytes-ceil-div4@1` proxy. Otherwise it keeps the original input
and records the fallback. This proxy is byte-derived, not the provider's
tokenizer. The actual selected reply contract binds the delivered input; the
undelivered baseline contract is retained separately for reconstruction.
The audit child independently replays these layers from retained native input.

### Optional token-counted selection and retained observations

The programmatic selector now accepts `SemanticMetadataTokenCounter`, wrapping
an existing counting callable with its declared provider, model, tokenizer,
tokenizer revision and qualification (`estimate` or `provider_tokenizer`). The
existing `CalibratedTokenEstimator.estimate` method can supply that callable.
The runner's `semantic_metadata_token_counter` argument requires the explicit
common-bindings route and the pinned provider/model to match before counting
or provider allocation. This identity is caller-declared; its digest does not
authenticate tokenizer compatibility.

An injected counter produces `supervisor-semantic-metadata-selection@2`; the
default byte-proxy path retains its original `@1` receipt exactly. Both complete
rendered prompt strings include literal workspace, public instruction, Doctor
and reply instructions. Compact selection requires strictly fewer bytes and
strictly fewer counted tokens. Invalid or failing counts retain the native
input with a sanitized reason and no proxy rescue. A failed callback never
exports its exception text. The receipt binds the complete input digests,
counter identity and selected count, while provider usage, hidden CLI
scaffolding and complete-run savings remain unverified.

The offline census accepts the same counter and hashes its textual identities.
The runner census counts each complete input once and still stops before
provider discovery. Benchmark comparison retains an allowlisted representation
observation beside the invocation's native usage; these counts never charge the
token ledger or substitute for missing usage. Audit replay can check `@2` with
the same independently supplied counter. Without that callable, it reconstructs
the recorded selected bytes but leaves counter/selection verification false.
The subprocess audit has no trusted callable factory and therefore cannot
qualify an injected counter merely from its receipt.

There is currently no qualified Codex/Grok tokenizer factory in benchmark
profiles. The CLI keeps its byte-proxy behavior. Before using this opt-in in a
live trial, qualify a reviewed provider/model/tokenizer/revision factory,
deterministic replay and its exact measurement scope. Build and qualify a new
runtime archive containing the changed helpers; existing frozen archives remain
historical evidence. Then compare complete native sessions. This implementation
alone establishes no live token savings.

[`semantic_metadata_catalog.py`](../../ipfs_accelerate_py/agent_supervisor/runtime/semantic_metadata_catalog.py)
adds an owner-prepared catalog bridge. It pins a read-only artifact and compares
independently supplied task/revision/source/context bindings and the exact
native evidence population before native catalog/link registration. DuckLake
projection remains observational. Actual temporary DuckDB registration and
rollback controls were exercised. Active Quack transport and a DuckLake
extension deployment are separate qualifications; this bridge installs neither.
Registration cannot authorize model use or omit a required fact.

The benchmark configuration, Harbor wrapper, driver and runner accept
`semantic_metadata_view=common-bindings@1` explicitly. The original full arm
and `@1` transport are required. The signed implementation route must be the
model router; archive checks bind the current helpers, and preparation drift
refuses execution. Legacy configuration and input shapes remain the default.
Planning and the native validation/publication lifecycle are retained.

Four authored source fixtures show the selection boundary:

| Capsules | Complete original bytes | Candidate bytes | Selected view |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| 1 | 11,319 | 11,817 | Original |
| 3 | 18,959 | 18,394 | Common bindings |
| 8 | 38,505 | 35,290 | Common bindings |
| 22 | 93,321 | 82,665 | Common bindings |

These fixtures use one source file; the recorded benchmark's four worker
capsules covered two public source paths. Their common-field populations differ.
The table is offline representation evidence and cannot predict actual
benchmark input size, behavior, rewards or cumulative tokens.

## Additional token-efficiency controls (2026-10-12)

The opt-in `common-bindings-instruction@1` treatment extends the readable shared
metadata view. The current supervisor carries the public instruction both in
`semantic.raw_sources` and in the separately admitted verbatim requirements
block. This view replaces only the exact duplicated raw-source entry with a
path/hash/byte-bound reference to that block. The complete public instruction
remains inline. Other source text, native task state, Doctor context, workspace
mapping and reply instructions remain available. It requires the independently
admitted public-instruction receipt and matching captured source bytes; a
missing or stale binding refuses before provider discovery.

The original semantic input restores byte-for-byte. Selection compares both
complete rendered inputs, with byte/proxy selection or an explicitly injected
token counter. A candidate that does not shrink both required measurements
retains the original input and records the requested treatment and fallback.
Counter failure also retains the original input. Census stops before provider
discovery and emits measurements and identities, without source bodies. A
retained historical audit reconstructs the actual selected input even after the
code changes or the temporary checkout is removed. A retained token-counter
receipt alone cannot qualify an unavailable counter.

Use `--semantic-metadata-view common-bindings-instruction@1` when preparing a
full-supervisor experiment with `supervisor-semantic-router-input@1` and a rebuilt
runtime archive containing the current policy closure. It is also accepted by
the existing live census route. The default remains `legacy`; preparation,
archive and signed router checks still apply. This treatment does not change
planning or the provider selected through `llm_router`.

Capsule priority can additionally consume the existing retrieval index rather
than relying only on words in symbol names and paths. The programmatic
`prepare_initial_context(..., retrieval_ranked_capsules=True)` profile prepares
retrieval before capsules, then passes its artifact and digest to
`prepare_semantic_context(..., worker_retrieval=...)`. The owner replays the
query, verifies its exact source population, and maps hits to native symbols
using source and line-span identities. Up to 20 verified hits lead the order;
remaining symbols retain lexical priority. Existing required raw sources,
freshness/admission checks, capsule count and byte limits still apply. Rankings
cannot confer proof or permission to omit a required fact. The descriptor and
cold reload retain the exact selected retrieval binding. Historical audit
reconstructs the original ranking from retained sources, AST and query evidence
after code edits; it does not label those historical sources current. This remains a
programmatic profile, with no benchmark CLI flag. Published successors refuse
this profile until fresh retrieval regeneration is integrated; the ordinary
profile remains available for complete multi-step benchmark runs.

Comparison output now includes **total native tokens per official pass** and
**reported provider USD per official pass**. Each numerator includes all
supplied retained attempts, including failures. Unknown official rewards,
missing usage/cost or zero passes leave the affected ratio unavailable, with
explicit reasons. Cache inclusion semantics remain visible. These are observed
ratios for the supplied attempts, not verified bills or causal savings.

Qualification measurements and source-bound commands are retained in
[evidence/terminal-token-efficiency-20261012](evidence/terminal-token-efficiency-20261012/README.md).
No live token reduction or new official Terminal Bench reward is established by
these implementation tests. The next comparison should hold task, provider,
model, planning strategy, budget and reply contract fixed, change one treatment
at a time, and retain every attempt and its native usage.

## Next changes, in measurement order

1. **Census the actual prepared coding view.** Let the verified owner emit only
   row counts, shared-field populations, complete input digests/bytes/proxy and
   selected/fallback status. Preserve original source bodies privately; do not
   export them in diagnostic metadata. Do this before spending on a live pilot.
   The [runner census stop point](terminal_metadata_census.md) now constructs both
   complete inputs after current owner checks and stops before provider
   allocation. Administrative source preparation retains explicit authored-plan
   provenance; live planned input remains a separate scope.
   The fresh live Source384 census now measured **59,336 to 58,454 bytes**,
   an 882-byte reduction (1.49%), with exact restoration and zero coding calls.
   Its retained planning session used **25,441 native tokens**. Current source,
   owner/world, schema custody and cleanup checks passed. This completes the
   input census gate; the result remains byte evidence, without complete-run
   savings or benchmark reward. See the [live observation](terminal_metadata_census.md#actual-live-source384-census-2026-10-11).
2. **Use current formal status capsules to prevent redundant reasoning.** Resolve
   an accepted native receipt through the supported proof-cache gate, including
   render/commit revalidation. Present property, verdict, assumptions, dependency
   digest and residual obligation. Keep proved, disproved, inconclusive,
   unsupported, error and cancelled distinct. Open Doctor work alone cannot
   produce an accepted proof card. Replace repeated status material rather than
   appending a second card.
   This is the next implementation priority after the 1.49% live metadata
   reduction. Inventory actual accepted receipts and repeated status populations
   first; unsupported or absent evidence remains explicit. Qualify replacement
   against unchanged obligations and current dependency/source digests with
   offline refusal controls, then census the complete new input. Existing
   conditional spectral lemmas do not certify the whole eigenvalue task or
   qualify an unavailable/slower numerical route for benchmark execution.
   The [source-only inventory](evidence/terminal-live-census-20261011/formal-status-next-treatment-inventory-01.json)
   identifies `DoctorProofCacheGate.lookup`, render/commit revalidation and
   existing proof-context digest handles. The inspected Terminal wiring lacks a
   complete admitted proof-owner/key binding; actual accepted receipt and
   repeated-status coverage remain unknown. Begin with a closed owner audit,
   refuse absent bindings before opening storage, and retain the native input
   when evidence or measured benefit is absent.
   The new [formal-status census](terminal_formal_status_census.md) implements
   this admission boundary. Its Terminal opt-in reports current task/source/
   context bindings separately from the unavailable native proof binding;
   accepted receipt and repeated-status counts remain null, with no proof-owner
   operations. It preserves the native prompt. A programmatic host can supply
   an already admitted Doctor gate, complete keys, independently expected key
   identities and a current-binding probe. That lane checks native lookup and
   render revalidation, including visible revocations, and explicitly reports
   possible bookkeeping writes to the existing owner. It observes the requested
   keys, without an atomic owner snapshot or a reusable proof receipt.
   The scoped header workflow now retains [complete key inputs and restart
   custody](header_proof_key_custody.md) in its existing sealed native owner.
   Rebuilt preparation and fresh native kernel replay qualify native reuse.
   The reviewed [scoped header bridge](header_proof_cache_bridge.md) now admits
   a native local lemma after fresh kernel replay and provides bound render/commit
   checks. A typed `@2` receipt preserves assumptions and actual residual IDs;
   local assurance cannot authorize task completion. The flat completion, claim,
   policy and planning consumers refuse scope loss.
   The explicit `TerminalFormalStatusOwner` host entry now joins an existing
   scoped Doctor analysis and native gate/full keys to the actual signed task.
   It reconstructs the source scope independently, rechecks Terminal/source
   custody around consultations, fences the same owner across context exit and
   clears escaped counts on drift or cleanup errors. The container host forwards
   these trusted objects locally without changing worker input. Authored native
   owner tests qualify this boundary. Its current task/source/context probe still
   needs a typed binding to the new bridge's current native custody, profiles,
   implementations and executables, plus an independently expected generic
   receipt identity. Historical acceptance or a raw gate/key lookup cannot supply
   those checks. Reconnect the same current owners after restart, reimport with
   fresh native replay, then measure actual accepted coverage and repeats.
   No current Terminal proof coverage or token benefit has been established.
3. **Qualify a bounded owner lookup for progressive disclosure.** Required facts
   stay inline until the model has an actual qualified expansion interface.
   Typed queries should return an exact bounded population with an explicit
   unresolved frontier, source/task bindings and counted response costs. Avoid
   model-facing arbitrary SQL and assumptions about the generic Quack gateway.
   A source-only audit found reusable verified capsule/index readers, sealed
   producer-bound source materialization and bounded symbol-query primitives,
   but no capsule/source operation in the current Quack registry or qualified
   expansion tool in the coding CLI route. Start with read-only `capsule.get`
   and `source.get` attached to the existing current owner. Bind host-issued
   caller grant, task/revision, repository/source scope, root/context, owner
   generation/fence, request identity and byte/result bounds. Recheck current
   workspace source after edits on every read. Return exact identities,
   freshness/admission caveats, completeness, unresolved frontier and a bound
   continuation; account for the complete encoded response. Qualify actual CLI
   access, stale/foreign/tampered refusals and oversized responses before moving
   any required fact out of the prompt. Add ranked `symbol.query` afterward.
   This qualification reuses existing assets and requires no new training.
4. **Run a separately versioned matched trial.** First census the qualified
   treatment and retain enough measured input reduction to justify the trial.
   Keep one planning session and one coding session, model/reasoning/resource/
   setup budgets, original public inputs, reply schema and coding transport
   fixed. Vary one qualified treatment alone. A fallback run does not count as
   an observed treatment. Preserve both native administrative identities and
   compare reviewed semantic populations. Identical controls can still produce
   different plans. Report that distinction and require substantive native
   input matching for an exact one-factor claim.
5. **Use checked history deltas at decision boundaries.** Reconstruct a current
   context from an actually delivered parent plus changed facts. Bind parent,
   task, repository/tree, policy, schema and revision. Invalidate changed proof
   dependencies. DuckLake history does not grant authority to rewrite a native
   CLI's internal conversation or discard unresolved work.
6. **Evaluate retrieval separately.** Rank task dependency closures and proof
   obligations with the available autoencoders/embeddings. Measure required-fact
   coverage, missing/stale evidence and expansion cost before claiming omission
   is safe. Keep new training out of the first metadata-only comparison.

## Decide success from the complete run

Count the final cumulative native input plus output tokens for every retained
planning, coding, lookup, continuation and repair attempt. Use the existing
native accounting rules: Codex cached input is already a subset of input;
Grok's normalized final-envelope input excludes separately reported cache
reads/writes. Preserve that distinction and each receipt's completeness scope.
Reasoning output is already part of output. Do not sum
cumulative usage records as independent calls. Preserve failed attempts and
unknown usage rather than assigning zero.

Report total tokens, planning/coding phase totals, calls/turns, lookup payloads,
repairs, cost and latency alongside the original verifier reward, native
completion/publication and cleanup. Keep embedding/refresh accounting explicit.
Require final input reconstruction and schema custody. Repeat balanced matched
pairs before claiming repeatable savings. This first implementation establishes
representation and integration checks; live token savings remain unmeasured.
