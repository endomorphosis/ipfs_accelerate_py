# CI/CD Pipeline Updates for Mojo/MAX Integration

This document outlines the necessary updates to existing CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD) to support the integration of Mojo/MAX as a hardware target for model inference.

## 1. Environment Setup

The CI/CD environment must be configured to include the Mojo/MAX SDKs and their dependencies.

*   **Action:** Add steps to install Mojo and MAX SDKs.
    *   **Details:** This typically involves downloading the official installers or using package managers (if available) for Mojo and MAX. Ensure the necessary environment variables (e.g., `MOJO_HOME`, `MAX_HOME`) are set correctly.
    *   **Example (Conceptual GitHub Actions):**
        ```yaml
        - name: Install Mojo SDK
          run: |
            curl -LO https://developer.modular.com/mojo/install.sh
            sh install.sh
            echo "$HOME/.modular/bin" >> $GITHUB_PATH
            echo "MOJO_HOME=$HOME/.modular" >> $GITHUB_ENV
        - name: Install MAX SDK
          run: |
            # Assuming a similar installation process for MAX
            curl -LO https://developer.modular.com/max/install.sh
            sh install.sh
            echo "$HOME/.modular/max/bin" >> $GITHUB_PATH
            echo "MAX_HOME=$HOME/.modular/max" >> $GITHUB_ENV
        ```
*   **Action:** Ensure Python dependencies for Mojo/MAX integration are installed.
    *   **Details:** Add `max` and `mojo` (if available as Python packages) to `requirements.txt` or equivalent, and install them.
    *   **Example:**
        ```yaml
        - name: Install Python dependencies
          run: pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```

## 2. Build Steps

Models need to be compiled to Mojo/MAX IR/binaries as part of the build process.

*   **Action:** Add a build step to convert and compile models to `.mojomodel` artifacts.
    *   **Details:** This step will invoke the `MojoMaxIRConverter` (or similar tool) to take source models (e.g., PyTorch, ONNX) and produce optimized `.mojomodel` files.
    *   **Example (Conceptual GitHub Actions):**
        ```yaml
        - name: Compile Models to Mojo/MAX
          run: |
            python -c "
            from generators.models.mojo_max_converter import MojoMaxIRConverter
            converter = MojoMaxIRConverter()
            # Example: Convert a dummy PyTorch model
            # In a real scenario, this would iterate over actual models
            dummy_model_id = 'bert-base-uncased'
            conceptual_input_shapes = {'input_ids': (1, 128)}
            max_ir = converter.convert_from_pytorch(dummy_model_id, conceptual_input_shapes)
            optimized_ir = converter.optimize_max_ir(max_ir)
            compiled_path = converter.compile_to_mojomodel(optimized_ir, f'./compiled_models/{dummy_model_id.replace('/', '_')}')
            print(f'Successfully compiled: {compiled_path}')
            "
          working-directory: ./ipfs_accelerate_py # Adjust if script is elsewhere
        ```

## 3. Test Execution

Integrate the new end-to-end tests into the CI/CD pipeline.

*   **Action:** Add steps to run Mojo/MAX specific unit, integration, and functional tests.
    *   **Details:** These tests will validate the IR conversion, model loading, inference accuracy, and performance on Mojo/MAX.
    *   **Example (Conceptual GitHub Actions):**
        ```yaml
        - name: Run Mojo/MAX Tests
          run: |
            pytest test/mojo_max_tests/ # Assuming a dedicated test directory
        ```

## 4. Artifact Management

Store compiled `.mojomodel` artifacts for deployment or further testing.

*   **Action:** Upload compiled Mojo/MAX models as build artifacts.
    *   **Details:** This ensures that the compiled models are available for subsequent deployment stages or for manual inspection.
    *   **Example (Conceptual GitHub Actions):**
        ```yaml
        - name: Upload Compiled Mojo/MAX Models
          uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
          with:
            name: mojo-max-models
            path: ./ipfs_accelerate_py/compiled_models/ # Adjust path
        ```

## 5. Deployment (Optional, but Recommended)

If applicable, integrate deployment steps for Mojo/MAX models.

*   **Action:** Add steps to deploy the `.mojomodel` files to an inference server or target hardware.
    *   **Details:** This would involve using tools specific to the deployment environment (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes, cloud-specific deployment services).

This summary provides a high-level overview of the CI/CD changes. Specific commands and configurations will vary based on the chosen CI/CD platform and the project's exact structure.
