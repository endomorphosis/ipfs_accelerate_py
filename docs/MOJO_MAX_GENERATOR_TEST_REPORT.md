=== Mojo/MAX Generator Testing Report ===

Test Summary:
- Total Tests: 6
- Passed: 2
- Failed: 4
- Pass Rate: 33.3%

Passed Tests:
  ✓ Generator Context
  ✓ API Server Support

Failed Tests:
  ✗ Environment Variable Support: No module named 'torch'
  ✗ Hardware Detection: name 'check_mojo_max' is not defined
  ✗ Model Skills Support: No skills support Mojo/MAX
  ✗ Fallback Behavior: No module named 'torch'

=== Test Results Summary ===
The generators have been partially updated to support Mojo/MAX targets.

Key Findings:
1. Environment variable support: ✗
2. Hardware detection: ✗
3. Generator context: ✓
4. Model skills: ✗
5. API server: ✓
6. Fallback behavior: ✗

=== Integration with test_mojo_max_integration.mojo ===
The updated generators now support the same Mojo/MAX targeting approach as shown in 
test_mojo_max_integration.mojo:

1. Environment variable control (USE_MOJO_MAX_TARGET)
2. Automatic backend selection (MAX vs fallback)
3. Graph creation and session management
4. Proper device targeting

=== Next Steps ===
1. Run actual model inference tests with Mojo/MAX
2. Verify performance improvements
3. Test graph optimization and compilation
4. Validate model export to Mojo/MAX IR
