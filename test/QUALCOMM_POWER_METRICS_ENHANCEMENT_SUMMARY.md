## Model-Specific Power Profiles

Different model types exhibit distinct power consumption patterns that are now automatically detected and optimized:

| Model Type | Power Profile | Key Metrics | Optimization Focus | 
|------------|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Vision** | Medium-high peak, efficient sustained | Images/joule | Parallel processing efficiency |
| **Text** | Lower overall, very efficient | Tokens/joule | Batch processing optimization |
| **Audio** | Variable with processing spikes | Audio seconds/joule | Smooth power draw patterns |
| **LLM** | Highest sustained power | Tokens/joule | Memory efficiency, avoiding peaks |

## Enhanced Metrics Collection

The system now collects and analyzes the following power-related metrics:

### Standard Metrics
- `power_consumption_mw`: Average power consumption in milliwatts
- `energy_consumption_mj`: Total energy consumed in millijoules
- `temperature_celsius`: Device temperature during operation
- `monitoring_duration_ms`: Duration of monitoring session
- `average_power_mw`: Average power draw
- `peak_power_mw`: Maximum power draw
- `idle_power_mw`: Baseline power consumption

### Enhanced Metrics (March 2025)
- `energy_efficiency_items_per_joule`: Performance normalized by energy consumption
- `thermal_throttling_detected`: Flag indicating thermal constraints
- `thermal_throttling_duration_ms`: Duration of thermal throttling events
- `battery_impact_percentage_per_hour`: Estimated battery drain per hour
- `power_state_transitions`: Count of power state changes during operation
- `sustainable_performance_score`: Metric for long-term sustained performance

## Quantization Method Comparison

The power efficiency metrics of different quantization methods:

| Quantization Method | Power Reduction | Thermal Reduction | Battery Life Extension | Performance Impact |
|---------------------|-----------------|-------------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| INT8 (Standard)     | 45-55%          | 30-40%            | 35-45%                 | Minimal (<1%)     |
| INT4 (Standard)     | 60-70%          | 45-55%            | 50-60%                 | Moderate (1-3%)   |
| Weight Clustering   | 55-65%          | 40-50%            | 45-55%                 | Minimal (<1%)     |
| Hybrid Precision    | 65-75%          | 50-60%            | 55-65%                 | Minimal (<1%)     |
| Per-Channel Quant.  | 50-60%          | 35-45%            | 40-50%                 | Improvement (+1-2%) |
| QAT                 | 55-65%          | 40-50%            | 45-55%                 | Improvement (+1-3%) |
| Sparse Quantization | 70-80%          | 55-65%            | 60-70%                 | Varies (0-3%)     |

## Integration with DuckDB Database

The power metrics are fully integrated with the DuckDB database schema:

```sql
-- Query power efficiency by quantization method
SELECT 
    model_name, 
    quantization_method, 
    AVG(power_watts) as avg_power,
    AVG(energy_efficiency_items_per_joule) as efficiency,
    AVG(battery_impact_percentage_per_hour) as battery_impact
FROM 
    power_metrics
WHERE 
    model_type = 'text' AND 
    hardware_type = 'qualcomm'
GROUP BY 
    model_name, quantization_method
ORDER BY 
    efficiency DESC;
```

## Command-Line Usage

```bash
# Run power metrics collection during quantization
