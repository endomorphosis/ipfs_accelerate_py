## Performance Summary

### BERT Embeddings Performance

| Platform | Processing Speed | Memory Usage | Embedding Dimension | Notes |
|----------|------------------|--------------|---------------------|-------|
| CPU | 0.001s/sentence | N/A | 768 | Using local test model |
| CUDA | N/A | N/A | 768 | Using local test model |
| OpenVINO | N/A | N/A | 768 | Using local test model |

## Implementation Approach

Based on our testing, we've developed the following approach:

1. **Local Test Model Creation:** 
   - Each test module creates a small, functional model in `/tmp`
   - Models are compatible with all backends (CPU, CUDA, OpenVINO)
   - No authentication required, works offline

2. **Real Model Detection:**
   - Strong validation for implementation type (REAL vs MOCK)
   - Multiple detection layers to ensure accurate status reporting
   - Specific metrics for each model type

3. **Consistent Performance Reporting:**
   - Standardized metrics for each model family
   - Cross-platform comparison between CPU, CUDA and OpenVINO
   - Detailed timing and resource usage tracking

## Next Steps

1. Complete testing for all remaining models using local test models:
   - For text generation: LLAMA, T5, Language Model
   - For audio processing: WAV2VEC2, WHISPER, CLAP
   - For vision and multimodal: CLIP, XCLIP
   - For embeddings: Sentence Embeddings

2. Enhance performance metrics collection for each model type:
   - For text models: tokens/sec, memory usage, latency
   - For vision models: frames/sec, preprocessing time
   - For audio models: realtime factor, memory footprint
   - For embeddings: vectors/sec, dimensionality, memory usage

3. Add detailed reporting for multi-platform comparison
