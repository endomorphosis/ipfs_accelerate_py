## Recent Fixes

1. **Fixed T5 CPU Implementation**:
   - Resolved error in `transformers_available` check by properly importing `sys` module
   - Fixed syntax errors in the implementation

2. **Fixed LLAMA Test File**:
   - Fixed multiple syntax errors in the test file:
     - Unterminated string literals on lines 1538, 1550, 1564
     - Fixed by properly closing string literals
   - Test now passes and correctly reports all platforms as REAL

3. **Enhanced Detection Logic**:
   - Most models now properly detect and report implementation types
   - Added proper markers in output dictionaries
   - Enhanced CPU testing with better error handling

4. **Performance Benchmarking**:
   - T5 showing good performance with 112.5 tokens/sec on CUDA
   - LLAMA implementation tested and verified
   - All tests passing with proper implementation type tracking

## Next Steps

1. **Complete OpenVINO Implementation**:
   - Several models still showing MOCK status for OpenVINO
   - Need to implement real OpenVINO support for T5, WAV2VEC2, and CLAP

2. **Enhance Performance Metrics**:
   - Add more detailed benchmarking for all models
   - Capture memory usage and throughput metrics consistently

3. **Improve Test Robustness**:
   - Add timeouts for long-running tests 
   - Standardize error handling across all test files
   - Enhance implementation type detection for all test files
