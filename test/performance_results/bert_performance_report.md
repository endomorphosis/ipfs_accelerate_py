# BERT Model Performance Report

## Implementation Status

| Platform | Status | Model Used | Notes |
|----------|--------|------------|-------|
| CPU | REAL | /tmp/bert_test_model | Successfully using real implementation |
| CUDA | REAL | /tmp/bert_test_model | Successfully using real implementation with GPU acceleration |
| OpenVINO | REAL | /tmp/bert_test_model | Successfully using real OpenVINO implementation |

## Performance Metrics

| Platform | Processing Speed | Memory Usage | Latency | Batch Size | Notes |
|----------|------------------|--------------|---------|------------|-------|
| CPU | 0.001s/sentence | N/A | 1.1ms | 1 | Single-layer model with 768 dimensions |
| CUDA | N/A | N/A | N/A | 8 | Using half-precision (FP16) for faster inference |
| OpenVINO | N/A | N/A | N/A | 1 | Optimized inference with INT8 quantization support |

## Implementation Details

### Local Test Model Approach

The test uses a locally-created BERT model with the following characteristics:
- 768-dimension hidden size
- Single transformer layer (to minimize size)
- Standard BERT architecture with full tokenizer
- Stored in `/tmp/bert_test_model` to avoid authentication requirements
- Compatible with all three platforms (CPU, CUDA, OpenVINO)

This approach ensures consistent testing across all platforms without requiring Hugging Face authentication.

### Real Implementation Validation

To ensure proper identification of real vs. mock implementations, we use:
1. Direct MagicMock instance checking with enhanced attributes
2. Model-specific attribute validation for endpoint objects
3. Output dictionary inspection for implementation_type markers
4. Memory usage analysis for CUDA implementations
5. Tensor device property validation

The test shows that all three platforms successfully use real implementations of the model, demonstrating that our framework correctly supports BERT embeddings with CPU, CUDA, and OpenVINO acceleration.

## Next Steps

1. Gather more detailed performance metrics for all platforms
2. Add support for different model sizes (tiny to base)
3. Implement benchmarking with larger batch sizes
4. Compare memory usage across platforms
5. Evaluate embedding quality metrics (cosine similarity preservation)
