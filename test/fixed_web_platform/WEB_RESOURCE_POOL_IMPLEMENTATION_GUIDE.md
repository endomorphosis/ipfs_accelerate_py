## Using the Enhanced Implementation

### Basic Usage

```python
from fixed_web_platform.resource_pool_integration_enhanced import EnhancedResourcePoolIntegration

# Create integration with adaptive scaling
integration = EnhancedResourcePoolIntegration(
    max_connections=4,
    min_connections=1,
    adaptive_scaling=True
)

# Initialize integration
await integration.initialize()

# Get model with optimal browser and platform
model = await integration.get_model(
    model_name="bert-base-uncased",
    model_type="text_embedding",
    platform="webgpu"
)

# Run inference
result = await model({"input_text": "This is a test"})

# Close integration when done
await integration.close()
```

### Advanced Usage with Browser Preferences

```python
# Create integration with custom browser preferences
integration = EnhancedResourcePoolIntegration(
    max_connections=4,
    browser_preferences={
        'audio': 'firefox',  # Firefox is best for audio models with compute shaders
        'vision': 'chrome',  # Chrome for vision models
        'text_embedding': 'edge',  # Edge has excellent WebNN support
        'text_generation': 'chrome',
        'multimodal': 'chrome'
    },
    adaptive_scaling=True
)

# Initialize
await integration.initialize()

# Optimizations for specific model types
audio_model = await integration.get_model(
    model_name="whisper-tiny",
    model_type="audio",
    platform="webgpu",
    optimizations={'compute_shaders': True}  # Enable compute shader optimization
)

vision_model = await integration.get_model(
    model_name="vit-base-patch16-224",
    model_type="vision",
    platform="webgpu",
    optimizations={'precompile_shaders': True}  # Enable shader precompilation
)

# Run concurrent inference
results = await integration.execute_concurrent([
    (audio_model, audio_inputs),
    (vision_model, vision_inputs)
])
```
