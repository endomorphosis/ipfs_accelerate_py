# CI/CD Pipeline Reorganization

**Date: March 9, 2025**  
**Status: Completed**

## Overview

As part of the project reorganization, the CI/CD workflow files have been moved from `test/.github/workflows/` to `.github/workflows/` in the root directory. This change aligns with standard GitHub repository structure conventions and makes the CI/CD configuration more discoverable.

## Files Moved

The following workflow files have been moved:

1. `benchmark_db_ci.yml` - Runs benchmark tests and stores results in database
2. `update_compatibility_matrix.yml` - Updates the model compatibility matrix
3. `test_and_benchmark.yml` - Runs tests and benchmarks together
4. `integration_tests.yml` - Runs integration tests across platforms
5. `test_results_integration.yml` - Integrates test results into reports

## Path Updates in CI/CD Files

In addition to moving the workflow files, the file paths referenced in these workflows have been updated to reflect the new directory structure. The primary path changes are:

| Old Path | New Path |
|----------|----------|
| `test/scripts/` | `duckdb_api/scripts/` |
| `test/run_benchmark_with_db.py` | `duckdb_api/core/run_benchmark_with_db.py` |
| `test/benchmark_db_query.py` | `duckdb_api/core/benchmark_db_query.py` |
| `test/benchmark_regression_detector.py` | `duckdb_api/analysis/benchmark_regression_detector.py` |
| `test/hardware_model_predictor.py` | `predictive_performance/hardware_model_predictor.py` |
| `test/model_performance_predictor.py` | `predictive_performance/model_performance_predictor.py` |
| `test/create_benchmark_schema.py` | `duckdb_api/schema/create_benchmark_schema.py` |
| `test/ci_benchmark_integrator.py` | `duckdb_api/scripts/ci_benchmark_integrator.py` |
| `test/test_ipfs_accelerate.py` | `generators/models/test_ipfs_accelerate.py` |
| `test/generate_compatibility_matrix.py` | `duckdb_api/visualization/generate_compatibility_matrix.py` |
| `test/generate_enhanced_compatibility_matrix.py` | `duckdb_api/visualization/generate_enhanced_compatibility_matrix.py` |
| `test/integration_test_suite.py` | `generators/test_runners/integration_test_suite.py` |
| `test/web_platform_test_runner.py` | `fixed_web_platform/web_platform_test_runner.py` |

## Documentation Updates

Documentation references to CI/CD pipelines have been updated in:

1. `docs/CICD_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` - Updated all command examples and file paths
2. `CI_CD_PATH_UPDATES.md` - Created to document the CI/CD path migration
3. `update_ci_cd_paths.py` - A utility script that updates path references in CI/CD configs

## Implementation Details

The migration was performed in several steps:

1. **File Copying**: CI/CD workflow files were copied from `test/.github/workflows/` to `.github/workflows/`
2. **Path Updates**: A utility script was created to update all path references in the workflow files
3. **Documentation Updates**: All documentation references to these files were updated
4. **Script Updates**: Scripts that reference CI/CD workflows were updated to use the new locations
5. **Testing**: The CI/CD pipelines were tested to ensure they function with the updated paths

## Verification Strategy

The reorganized CI/CD pipelines have been verified by:

1. **File Structure**: Confirming all workflow files are correctly placed in the root `.github/workflows/` directory
2. **Path References**: Ensuring all path references have been updated to the new directory structure
3. **Syntax Validation**: Checking that YAML files remain syntactically valid
4. **Documentation**: Verifying documentation correctly describes the new structure and paths

## Future Considerations

For continued development of the CI/CD system:

1. **Workflow Consolidation**: Consider further consolidating similar workflows
2. **Pipeline as Code**: Implement more parameterization and reusable workflows
3. **Local Testing**: Enhance capabilities for local testing of CI/CD pipelines
4. **Dependency Management**: Implement better versioning of dependencies in CI/CD environments
