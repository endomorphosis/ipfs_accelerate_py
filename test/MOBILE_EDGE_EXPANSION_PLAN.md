## Overview

The Mobile/Edge Support Expansion Plan outlines the strategy for extending the IPFS Accelerate Python Framework to better support mobile and edge devices, with a particular focus on Qualcomm AI Engine integration. The plan includes assessment of current Qualcomm support coverage, identification of high-priority models for optimization, battery impact analysis methodology, and mobile test harness specifications.

## Current Status

As of April 2025, Qualcomm support in the framework has reached **80%** model coverage, with specialized optimization techniques for key model families. The implementation includes support for multiple quantization methods and power state management, comprehensive battery impact analysis, and dedicated mobile test harnesses for both Android and iOS.

## Key Components
