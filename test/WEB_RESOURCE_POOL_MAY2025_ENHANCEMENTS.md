## 1. Fault-Tolerant Cross-Browser Model Sharding

This enhancement enables the system to shard large models across multiple browsers with comprehensive fault tolerance and recovery mechanisms.

### Key Features

- **Cross-Browser Model Sharding**: Distributes model components across multiple browsers to handle large models and leverage browser-specific strengths
- **Automatic Failure Recovery**: Detects and recovers from component failures using a progressive recovery strategy
- **Browser-Specific Optimization**: Allocates model components to browsers based on their specialization (Firefox for audio, Edge for text, etc.)
- **Multiple Sharding Strategies**:
  - **Layer-based**: Distributes model layers across browsers
  - **Attention-Feedforward**: Separate attention and feedforward components
  - **Component-based**: Distributes by model components (e.g., text encoder, vision encoder)
- **Detailed Execution Metrics**: Provides comprehensive metrics on component execution and recovery

### Implementation

The system implements a `ModelShardingManager` with these capabilities:
- Optimal browser allocation based on model type and component function
- Concurrent or sequential component execution based on dependencies
- Progressive component recovery with multiple strategies:
  1. Simple retry with existing component
  2. Browser change for problematic components
- Result merging based on sharding strategy and component function

### Usage Example

```python
# Create model sharding manager
sharding_manager = ModelShardingManager(
    model_name="llama-7b",
    num_shards=4,
    shard_type="layer",
    model_type="text",
    max_connections=4
)

# Initialize model with automatic browser allocation
await sharding_manager.initialize_sharding()

# Run inference with fault tolerance
result = await sharding_manager.run_inference_sharded(
    inputs={"input_ids": [101, 2023, 2003, 1037, 3231, 102]},
    max_retries=2
)

# Access detailed performance metrics
print(f"Inference time: {result['metrics']['inference_time_ms']}ms")
print(f"Success rate: {result['metrics']['successful_components']}/{result['metrics']['component_count']}")
```

### Implementation Status

## 2. Performance-Aware Browser Selection

A key enhancement in this update is the intelligent, data-driven browser selection mechanism that automatically chooses the optimal browser for each model type based on historical performance data.

### Key Features

- **Performance History Tracking**: Collects and analyzes comprehensive performance metrics for each model-browser combination
- **Intelligent Browser Selection**: Automatically selects the optimal browser based on historical success rate and latency metrics
- **Weighted Scoring System**: Uses a weighted combination of success rate (70%) and latency (30%) for browser selection
- **Trend Analysis**: Provides actionable recommendations for optimal browser configuration based on accumulated performance data
- **Self-Adapting System**: Continuously updates performance metrics to adapt to changing browser capabilities and performance characteristics

### Implementation

The system maintains a performance history data structure that tracks:
- Success/failure rates by model type and browser
- Average latency for each model-browser combination
- Reliability metrics for recovery operations
- Sample counts to ensure statistical significance

This history is used to compute optimal browser allocations for new models and to provide performance trend analysis with specific recommendations.

### Usage Example

```python
# Use performance-aware browser selection
model = accelerator.accelerate_model(
    model_name="whisper-tiny",
    model_type="audio",
    use_performance_history=True  # Will select Firefox for audio models
)

# Get performance trend analysis
analysis = accelerator.analyze_performance_trends()
print(f"Recommended browser for audio models: {analysis['model_type_affinities']['audio']['optimal_browser']}")
```

### Implementation Status

âœ… Performance tracking mechanism complete
âœ… Weighted scoring system implemented
âœ… Browser recommendation engine complete

    days=30,
    include_statistics=True,
    model_types=["text", "audio", "vision"]
