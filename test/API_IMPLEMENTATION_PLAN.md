# API Implementation Testing Plan

## Overview

This document outlines a comprehensive plan for testing the IPFS Accelerate API backends to verify they are using real implementations rather than mock objects. Based on our initial analysis, we have identified which APIs need further implementation work.

## Current Implementation Status

| API | Status | Implementation | Priority |
|-----|--------|---------------|----------|
| Claude (Anthropic) | REAL | REAL | âœ… Complete |
| OpenAI | MOCK | MOCK | ðŸ”´ High |
| Groq | MOCK | MOCK | ðŸ”´ High |
| Ollama | INCOMPLETE | INCOMPLETE | ðŸŸ¡ Medium |
| Hugging Face TGI | INCOMPLETE | INCOMPLETE | ðŸŸ¡ Medium |
| Gemini | INCOMPLETE | INCOMPLETE | ðŸŸ¡ Medium |
| HF TEI | Not Tested | Not Tested | ðŸŸ¢ Low |
| LLVM | Not Tested | Not Tested | ðŸŸ¢ Low |
| OVMS | Not Tested | Not Tested | ðŸŸ¢ Low |
| S3 Kit | Not Tested | Not Tested | ðŸŸ¢ Low |
| OPEA | Not Tested | Not Tested | ðŸŸ¢ Low |

## Implementation Work Plan

### Phase 1: High Priority APIs (OpenAI, Groq)

OpenAI and Groq are widely used LLM APIs that should be prioritized for real implementation:

1. **OpenAI API**
   - The existing implementation is mocked but has the correct method structure
   - Replace mock implementations with real OpenAI API calls
   - Add proper authentication and error handling
   - Implement the following endpoints:
     - Chat completion
     - Text completion
     - Embeddings
     - Image generation
     - Audio transcription/translation

2. **Groq API**
   - Currently a mock implementation
   - Implement real API calls to Groq's inference endpoints
   - Add proper authentication and rate limiting handling
   - Support both chat and completion formats

### Phase 2: Medium Priority APIs (Ollama, HF TGI, Gemini)

These APIs provide important functionality for local deployments and alternative models:

1. **Ollama API**
   - Currently incomplete implementation
   - Add proper endpoint handling for local Ollama servers
   - Implement streaming support
   - Add model management capabilities

2. **Hugging Face TGI API**
   - Currently incomplete implementation
   - Add support for Text Generation Inference API
   - Implement proper authentication with HF tokens
   - Support various model parameters and configurations

3. **Gemini API**
   - Currently incomplete implementation
   - Add Google AI Gemini model support
   - Implement multimodal capabilities
   - Add proper authentication and error handling

### Phase 3: Low Priority APIs (HF TEI, LLVM, OVMS, S3 Kit, OPEA)

These specialized APIs can be implemented after the core APIs are complete:

1. **Hugging Face TEI API**
   - Implement Text Embedding Inference API support
   - Add embedding model support
   - Implement proper error handling

2. **LLVM API**
   - Add support for LLVM-based model execution
   - Implement proper model loading and resource management

3. **OpenVINO Model Server (OVMS)**
   - Implement OpenVINO model server client
   - Add support for model conversion and optimization

4. **S3 Kit**
   - Implement secure model storage and retrieval
   - Add model versioning support

5. **OPEA**
   - Implement Open Platform for Enterprise AI support
   - Add enterprise authentication features

## Testing Approach

For each API, we will follow this testing methodology:

1. **Static Analysis**
   - Use the `check_api_implementation.py` script to analyze code structure
   - Identify mock patterns and substitute with real implementations
   - Check method code size and complexity to differentiate stubs from real implementations

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Implement tests that make actual API calls with proper credentials
   - Verify responses match expected formats and content
   - Test error cases and rate limiting behavior

3. **Documentation**
   - Update implementation status in `API_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
   - Document credential requirements and setup procedures
   - Add examples for each API endpoint

## Credential Management

To facilitate testing with real API implementations:

1. **Local Development**
   - Use `.ipfs_api_credentials` in the home directory for storing API keys
   - Support environment variables for CI/CD environments
   - Implement proper credential masking in logs

2. **Production Integration**
   - Document proper credential storage practices
   - Implement credential rotation mechanisms
   - Add support for managed identity services

## Implementation Guidelines

When implementing real API backends:

1. **Authentication**
   - Support multiple authentication methods (API keys, OAuth, etc.)
   - Implement proper error handling for authentication failures
   - Add retry logic for transient authentication issues

2. **Rate Limiting**
   - Add proper rate limit detection and handling
   - Implement exponential backoff for retries
   - Add usage tracking and quota management

3. **Error Handling**
   - Provide detailed error messages and suggestions
   - Map API-specific errors to consistent format
   - Log errors with appropriate verbosity levels

4. **Response Processing**
   - Normalize responses across different APIs
   - Handle streaming responses consistently
   - Process multimodal content appropriately

## Conclusion

By following this implementation plan, we will systematically replace mock implementations with real API integrations, ensuring that the IPFS Accelerate framework provides reliable and consistent access to AI models across different providers. The priority order ensures that the most widely used APIs are implemented first, while maintaining a roadmap for comprehensive API support.
