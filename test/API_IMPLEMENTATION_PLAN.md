## Testing Approach

For each API, we will follow this testing methodology:

1. **Static Analysis**
   - Use the `check_api_implementation.py` script to analyze code structure
   - Identify mock patterns and substitute with real implementations
   - Check method code size and complexity to differentiate stubs from real implementations

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Implement tests that make actual API calls with proper credentials
   - Verify responses match expected formats and content
   - Test error cases and rate limiting behavior

3. **Documentation**
   - Update implementation status in `API_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`
   - Document credential requirements and setup procedures
   - Add examples for each API endpoint

## Credential Management

To facilitate testing with real API implementations:

1. **Local Development**
   - Use `.ipfs_api_credentials` in the home directory for storing API keys
   - Support environment variables for CI/CD environments
   - Implement proper credential masking in logs

2. **Production Integration**
   - Document proper credential storage practices
   - Implement credential rotation mechanisms
   - Add support for managed identity services

## Implementation Guidelines

When implementing real API backends:

1. **Authentication**
   - Support multiple authentication methods (API keys, OAuth, etc.)
   - Implement proper error handling for authentication failures
   - Add retry logic for transient authentication issues

2. **Rate Limiting**
   - Add proper rate limit detection and handling
   - Implement exponential backoff for retries
   - Add usage tracking and quota management

3. **Error Handling**
   - Provide detailed error messages and suggestions
   - Map API-specific errors to consistent format
   - Log errors with appropriate verbosity levels

4. **Response Processing**
   - Normalize responses across different APIs
   - Handle streaming responses consistently
   - Process multimodal content appropriately

## Conclusion

By following this implementation plan, we will systematically replace mock implementations with real API integrations, ensuring that the IPFS Accelerate framework provides reliable and consistent access to AI models across different providers. The priority order ensures that the most widely used APIs are implemented first, while maintaining a roadmap for comprehensive API support.
