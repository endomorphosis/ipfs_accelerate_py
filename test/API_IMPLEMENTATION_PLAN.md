   - ✅ Checked method code size and complexity to differentiate stubs from real implementations

2. **Integration Testing**
   - ✅ Implemented tests that make actual API calls with proper credentials
   - ✅ Verified responses match expected formats and content
   - ✅ Tested error cases and rate limiting behavior
   - ✅ Verified queue and backoff functionality with high concurrency

3. **Documentation**
   - ✅ Updated implementation status in API_IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md
   - ✅ Documented credential requirements and setup procedures
   - ✅ Added examples for each API endpoint in API_QUICKSTART.md

## Credential Management

For testing with real API implementations:

1. **Local Development**
   - ✅ Added support for .ipfs_api_credentials in the home directory
   - ✅ Implemented environment variable support for CI/CD environments
   - ✅ Added proper credential masking in logs

2. **Production Integration**
   - ✅ Documented credential storage best practices
   - ✅ Implemented credential rotation mechanisms

## Conclusion

The API implementation plan has been successfully completed, delivering a comprehensive set of API backends for the IPFS Accelerate framework. By following the phased approach outlined above, we've implemented all 11 API backends consistently with proper error handling, queueing, and backoff mechanisms.

All implementation items listed in this plan have been addressed, including queue systems, exponential backoff, API key management, request tracking, and monitoring capabilities. The final implementation includes additional advanced features such as priority queues, circuit breaker patterns, and API key multiplexing that enhance the reliability and performance of the framework.

The test suites for each API backend have been implemented and verified, and all APIs now show as COMPLETE status in the implementation status report. The framework now provides a robust, unified interface for accessing a wide range of AI services from commercial APIs to local deployments.
