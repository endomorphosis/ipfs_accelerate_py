## Implementation Summary

All API backends have been successfully fixed and implemented with robust queue and backoff systems. Here is the current status:

### All API Backends Now Working:
- **Claude**: Complete implementation with working request queue and backoff
- **OpenAI**: Complete implementation with working request queue, backoff, and function calling
- **Groq**: Complete implementation with statistical tracking and model compatibility support
- **Gemini**: Fixed syntax errors and completed implementation with multimodal support
- **HF TEI**: Fixed attribute errors and implemented queue processing correctly
- **HF TGI**: Fixed attribute errors and implemented queue processing correctly

- **OPEA**: Fixed test failures and completed implementation
- **OVMS**: Complete implementation with per-endpoint API key support
- **S3 Kit**: Implemented missing test file and fixed queue implementation

### Fixes Implemented:
1. **Queue Implementation Consistency:**
   - Standardized queue implementation across all APIs using list-based queues
   - Fixed queue_processing attribute initialization in all APIs
   - Implemented consistent queue processing methods with proper thread safety
   - Standardized queue access patterns (replace Queue.get() with list.pop(0))

2. **Module Structure and Initialization:**
   - Fixed module import structure in __init__.py for proper API class instantiation
   - Resolved "'module' object is not callable" errors in test scripts
   - Ensured all API classes have the same name as their module files
   - Implemented consistent class initialization across all backends
   - Added proper exception handling for imports in __init__.py

3. **Syntax and Error Handling:**
   - Fixed all syntax and indentation errors in all API implementations
   - Standardized error handling with consistent try/except patterns
   - Implemented robust request tracking with unique IDs
   - Fixed major indentation issues in the Ollama implementation

4. **Test Coverage:**
   - Created missing test files for LLVM and S3 Kit
   - Fixed failing tests for OPEA and other backends
   - Implemented consistent test coverage for all APIs
   - Added verification scripts to ensure API components function properly

### Advanced Features Implemented:
1. **Priority Queue System:**
   - Three-tier priority levels (HIGH, NORMAL, LOW)
   - Thread-safe request queueing with concurrency limits
   - Dynamic queue size configuration with overflow handling
   - Priority-based scheduling and processing
   - Queue status monitoring and metrics

2. **Circuit Breaker Pattern:**
   - Three-state machine (CLOSED, OPEN, HALF-OPEN)
   - Automatic service outage detection
   - Self-healing capabilities with configurable timeouts
   - Failure threshold configuration
   - Fast-fail for unresponsive services

3. **API Key Multiplexing:**
   - Multiple API key management for each provider
   - Automatic round-robin key rotation
   - Least-loaded key selection strategy
   - Per-key usage tracking and metrics

4. **Semantic Caching:** 
   - Caching based on semantic similarity
   - Automatic embedding of queries for cache matching
   - Configurable similarity threshold
   - Cache expiry and management

5. **Request Batching:**
   - Automatic request combining for compatible models
   - Configurable batch size and timeout
   - Model-specific batching strategies
   - Batch queue management
