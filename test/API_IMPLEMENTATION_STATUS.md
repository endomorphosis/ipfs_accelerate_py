## Implementation Summary

After completing the implementation of API backends with proper queue and backoff systems, several issues need to be resolved:

### Fixed API Backends:
- Claude: Complete with working tests
- OpenAI: Complete with working tests
- OVMS: Complete with working tests and per-endpoint API key support

### API Backends With Issues:
- Gemini: Syntax errors in try/except blocks
- Groq: Import errors - class not found correctly
- HF TEI: Attribute errors - queue_processing missing
- HF TGI: Attribute errors - queue_processing missing
- LLVM: Missing test file
- Ollama: Import errors - class not found correctly
- OPEA: Tests failing
- S3 Kit: Missing test file

### Required Fixes:
1. Fix syntax errors in Gemini API implementation
2. Add missing queue_processing attribute to HF TGI/TEI
3. Fix import errors in Groq and Ollama
4. Create missing test files for LLVM and S3 Kit
5. Fix failing tests for OPEA

### Test Tools Requiring Fixes:
- add_queue_backoff.py: Syntax errors in docstrings
- update_api_tests.py: "retry-after" error 

Priority should be given to complete the Claude, OpenAI and Ollama API implementations as these are most commonly used.

- **Total APIs**: 11
- **Working Implementations**: 2 (18.2%)
- **Implementations With Issues**: 9 (81.8%)

## Next Steps

1. Add comprehensive testing for all APIs with real API credentials
2. Add unified documentation for all APIs with examples
3. Enhance error handling for edge cases and service-specific errors
4. Add performance monitoring and metrics collection
5. Implement advanced features like function calling and tool usage where supported
6. Create standardized examples for all API types
