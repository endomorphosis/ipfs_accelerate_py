## Core Features Implemented

Each API implementation includes these standard features:

### 1. Request Queueing
- Thread-safe request queue with proper locking
- Concurrency control with configurable limits
- Queue size management with overflow handling
- Priority levels (HIGH/NORMAL/LOW)

### 2. Exponential Backoff
- Rate limit detection via status code analysis
- Configurable retry count with maximum limits
- Progressive delay increase with backoff factor
- Maximum retry timeout to prevent endless retries
- Circuit breaker pattern for service outage detection

### 3. API Key Management
- Environment variable detection with fallback chain
- Configuration file support with validation
- Runtime configuration via parameter passing
- Multiple API key support with rotation strategies

### 4. Request Tracking
- Unique request ID generation with UUID
- Success/failure recording with timestamps
- Token usage tracking for billing purposes
- Performance metrics collection

### 5. Error Handling
- Standardized error classification across APIs
- Detailed error messages with context information
- Recovery mechanisms with retry logic
- Proper exception propagation to caller

## Next Steps

While all API implementations are now complete, we recommend these follow-up actions:

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Benchmark all API implementations for throughput and latency
   - Identify and resolve performance bottlenecks
   - Implement efficient batching strategies where applicable

2. **Enhanced Features**
   - Add semantic caching for frequently used requests
   - Implement advanced rate limiting strategies
   - Add comprehensive metrics dashboards

3. **Documentation and Examples**
   - Create detailed API usage guides
   - Develop common patterns and best practices
   - Provide benchmark comparisons between APIs

## Conclusion

The API implementation plan is now 100% complete, with all 11 target APIs fully implemented. The framework provides a consistent, robust interface for accessing a wide range of AI services, from commercial APIs to local deployments, with comprehensive error handling, request management, and monitoring capabilities.
