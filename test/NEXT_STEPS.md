## Predictive Performance System Roadmap (Q2 2025 - HIGH PRIORITY)

With the Predictive Performance System elevated to our highest priority initiative for Q2 2025, this system will provide:

1. **Critical Business Value**:
   - Reduce hardware testing costs by 60-75% through accurate performance predictions
   - Enable hardware selection without physical access to all platforms
   - Provide confidence scoring for all predictions to guide decision making
   - Create active learning pipeline to strategically allocate testing resources

2. **Technical Innovation**:
   - Combine gradient boosting and neural network approaches for optimal accuracy
   - Implement transfer learning across model families for better generalization
   - Create hardware-aware feature engineering with detailed capability vectors
   - Build uncertainty quantification system for reliable confidence metrics

3. **Integration Benefits**:
   - Direct integration with hardware selection API and automated benchmark system
   - Streaming integration with existing performance database
   - Real-time prediction API for interactive hardware selection
   - Visualization components for exploring prediction accuracy and relationships

This system will fundamentally transform our approach to hardware selection and benchmarking, providing substantial cost savings while improving the accuracy and reliability of our performance predictions.

## Simulation Quality and Validation Roadmap (Q3-Q4 2025)

The focus on simulation quality and validation reflects our commitment to providing accurate benchmarking and hardware recommendations even when physical hardware isn't available:

### Simulation Accuracy Framework
- Develop statistical validation methodology for simulation vs. real hardware
- Implement confidence scoring for all simulation results
- Create calibration system to continuously improve simulation accuracy
- Build comprehensive measurement of simulation drift over time
- Design simulation scenarios that accurately predict real-world performance

### Benchmark Validation System
- Create automated tools to detect simulation/real-hardware discrepancies
- Implement reproducibility testing for all benchmark configurations
- Design benchmark certification process for validated results
- Build comprehensive statistical analysis for benchmark outlier detection
- Develop continuous monitoring for benchmark stability across releases

### Code Quality Management
- Implement static analysis specifically for simulation code patterns
- Create automatic archiving of problematic or outdated Python files
- Build AI-assisted code improvement suggestions for simulation code
- Design comprehensive simulation code quality metrics
- Develop best practices documentation for simulation implementation

This initiative ensures our simulation capabilities maintain the highest standards of accuracy and reliability, providing trustworthy results for hardware selection and optimization even when direct hardware testing isn't possible.
