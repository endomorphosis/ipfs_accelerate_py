# Predictive Performance System

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Date:** March 15, 2025  
**Status:** Active Development (70% Complete)

## Overview

The Predictive Performance System is a machine learning-based framework that predicts performance metrics for AI models across different hardware platforms without requiring exhaustive benchmarking. This system enables efficient resource planning, configuration optimization, and hardware selection by leveraging existing benchmark data to make accurate predictions for untested configurations.

## Key Components

The Predictive Performance System consists of four primary modules:

1. **Initialization Module (`initialize.py`)**: Sets up the system by loading benchmark data, analyzing data coverage, and preparing datasets for model training.

2. **Training Module (`train_models.py`)**: Trains machine learning models to predict performance metrics (throughput, latency, memory usage) for different hardware-model combinations.

3. **Prediction Module (`predict.py`)**: Makes predictions for specific configurations, generates prediction matrices, and visualizes results with confidence scores.

4. **Active Learning Module (`active_learning.py`)**: Implements a targeted data collection approach to identify high-value benchmark configurations using uncertainty estimation, diversity weighting, and expected information gain techniques.

5. **Hardware Recommender (`hardware_recommender.py`)**: Suggests optimal hardware platforms for specific model configurations based on predicted performance metrics.

## Features

- **ML-Based Performance Prediction**: Predicts throughput, latency, memory usage, and power consumption
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provides reliability measures for each prediction
- **Hardware Recommendation**: Suggests optimal hardware for specific model configurations
- **Active Learning**: Identifies high-value benchmark configurations
- **Integrated Recommendation**: Combines active learning and hardware recommendation
- **Visualization Tools**: Generates heatmaps, comparative charts, and prediction matrices
- **DuckDB Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with the benchmark database

## Installation

The Predictive Performance System is integrated with the IPFS Accelerate Python Framework. No additional installation is required beyond the framework's standard dependencies.

## Quick Start

```python
# Import components
from predictive_performance.predict import PerformancePredictor
from predictive_performance.active_learning import ActiveLearningSystem
from predictive_performance.hardware_recommender import HardwareRecommender

# Initialize predictor
predictor = PerformancePredictor()

# Make a prediction
prediction = predictor.predict(
    model_name="bert-base-uncased",
    model_type="text_embedding",
    hardware_platform="cuda",
    batch_size=4
)

# Print prediction with confidence
print(f"Predicted throughput: {prediction['throughput']:.2f} items/sec (confidence: {prediction.get('confidence_score', 0)*100:.1f}%)")

# Get hardware recommendation
hw_recommender = HardwareRecommender(predictor=predictor)
recommendation = hw_recommender.recommend_hardware(
    model_name="bert-base-uncased",
    model_type="text_embedding",
    batch_size=4,
    optimization_metric="throughput"
)

# Print recommendation
print(f"Recommended hardware: {recommendation['recommended_hardware']}")

# Get active learning recommendations
active_learner = ActiveLearningSystem()
configurations = active_learner.recommend_configurations(budget=5)

# Print high-value configurations
for i, config in enumerate(configurations):
    print(f"Configuration #{i+1}: {config['model_name']} on {config['hardware']}")
    print(f"  Expected information gain: {config.get('expected_information_gain', 0):.4f}")

# Generate integrated recommendations
integrated_results = active_learner.integrate_with_hardware_recommender(
    hardware_recommender=hw_recommender,
    test_budget=5,
    optimize_for="throughput"
)

# Print integrated recommendations
for i, config in enumerate(integrated_results["recommendations"]):
    print(f"Integrated recommendation #{i+1}: {config['model_name']} on {config['hardware']}")
    print(f"  Recommended hardware: {config.get('recommended_hardware', 'N/A')}")
    print(f"  Combined score: {config.get('combined_score', 0):.4f}")
```

## Command-Line Usage

The Predictive Performance System includes a comprehensive command-line interface:

```bash
# Make a prediction for a specific configuration
python example.py predict --model bert-base-uncased --hardware cuda --batch-size 4

# Compare performance across hardware platforms
python example.py compare-hardware --model bert-base-uncased

# Get hardware recommendation
python example.py recommend-hardware --model bert-base-uncased --metric throughput

# Get active learning recommendations
python example.py active-learning --budget 10

# Generate integrated recommendations
python example.py integrate --budget 5 --metric throughput --output recommendations.json

# Run a comprehensive demo
python example.py demo
```
