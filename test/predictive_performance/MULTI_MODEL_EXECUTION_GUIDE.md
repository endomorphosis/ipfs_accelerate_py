# Multi-Model Execution Support Guide

**Version:** 0.1.0  
**Date:** March 18, 2025  
**Status:** In Progress (10% Complete)

## Overview

The Multi-Model Execution Support module enables the Predictive Performance System to predict performance metrics for scenarios where multiple AI models are executed concurrently on the same hardware. This capability is crucial for real-world applications where several models often run simultaneously, competing for shared resources and potentially benefiting from cross-model optimizations.

## Key Features

- **Resource Contention Modeling**: Predicts performance impact when multiple models compete for CPU, GPU, and memory resources
- **Cross-Model Tensor Sharing**: Estimates efficiency gains from shared tensor memory between compatible models
- **Execution Strategy Recommendation**: Suggests optimal execution strategies (parallel, sequential, or batched)
- **Scheduling Simulation**: Generates execution schedules with timeline visualization
- **Memory Optimization Modeling**: Predicts memory savings from cross-model optimizations
- **Web Resource Pool Integration**: Supports browser-based concurrent model execution

## Getting Started

### Basic Usage

```python
from predictive_performance.multi_model_execution import MultiModelPredictor
from predictive_performance.predict import PerformancePredictor

# Initialize single-model predictor and multi-model predictor
single_predictor = PerformancePredictor()
multi_predictor = MultiModelPredictor(single_model_predictor=single_predictor)

# Define model configurations
model_configs = [
    {"model_name": "bert-base-uncased", "model_type": "text_embedding", "batch_size": 4},
    {"model_name": "vit-base-patch16-224", "model_type": "vision", "batch_size": 1},
    {"model_name": "t5-small", "model_type": "text_generation", "batch_size": 2}
]

# Predict performance for concurrent execution
prediction = multi_predictor.predict_multi_model_performance(
    model_configs,
    hardware_platform="cuda",
    execution_strategy="parallel"
)

# Print results
print(f"Total Throughput: {prediction['total_metrics']['combined_throughput']} items/sec")
print(f"Total Latency: {prediction['total_metrics']['combined_latency']} ms")
print(f"Total Memory: {prediction['total_metrics']['combined_memory']} MB")
```

### Execution Strategy Recommendation

```python
# Get recommended execution strategy
recommendation = multi_predictor.recommend_execution_strategy(
    model_configs,
    hardware_platform="cuda",
    optimization_goal="throughput"  # Options: "throughput", "latency", "memory"
)

print(f"Recommended Strategy: {recommendation['recommended_strategy']}")
print(f"Optimization Goal: {recommendation['optimization_goal']}")

# Compare different strategies
for strategy, metrics in recommendation['all_predictions'].items():
    print(f"\n{strategy.capitalize()} Strategy:")
    print(f"  Throughput: {metrics['combined_throughput']} items/sec")
    print(f"  Latency: {metrics['combined_latency']} ms")
    print(f"  Memory: {metrics['combined_memory']} MB")
```

## Execution Strategies

The Multi-Model Execution Support module provides three main execution strategies:

### 1. Parallel Execution

All models run concurrently, competing for resources but potentially achieving higher throughput:

- **Pros**: Maximizes hardware utilization, minimizes total execution time
- **Cons**: Higher resource contention, potential memory issues
- **Best For**: Scenarios with high-throughput requirements and sufficient hardware resources

```python
prediction = multi_predictor.predict_multi_model_performance(
    model_configs,
    hardware_platform="cuda",
    execution_strategy="parallel"
)
```

### 2. Sequential Execution

Models run one after another, eliminating resource contention but increasing total execution time:

- **Pros**: Minimal resource contention, consistent performance
- **Cons**: Longer total execution time, lower throughput
- **Best For**: Memory-constrained environments or when consistent performance is crucial

```python
prediction = multi_predictor.predict_multi_model_performance(
    model_configs,
    hardware_platform="cuda",
    execution_strategy="sequential"
)
```

### 3. Batched Execution

Models are grouped into batches that run sequentially, with concurrent execution within each batch:

- **Pros**: Balance between resource utilization and contention
- **Cons**: More complex scheduling, potentially suboptimal for some workloads
- **Best For**: Mixed workloads with varying resource requirements

```python
prediction = multi_predictor.predict_multi_model_performance(
    model_configs,
    hardware_platform="cuda",
    execution_strategy="batched"
)
```

## Resource Contention Modeling

The module uses sophisticated resource contention models to predict performance degradation when multiple models compete for shared resources:

```python
# Examining contention factors
contention_factors = prediction["contention_factors"]

print(f"Compute Contention: {contention_factors['compute_contention']:.2f}x")
print(f"Memory Bandwidth Contention: {contention_factors['memory_bandwidth_contention']:.2f}x")
print(f"Memory Contention: {contention_factors['memory_contention']:.2f}x")
```

Each contention factor represents the multiplier applied to latency or the divisor applied to throughput due to resource competition.

## Cross-Model Tensor Sharing

The module predicts potential benefits from tensor sharing between compatible models:

```python
# Examining sharing benefits
sharing_benefits = prediction["sharing_benefits"]

print(f"Memory Benefit: {sharing_benefits['memory_benefit']:.2f}x")
print(f"Compute Benefit: {sharing_benefits['compute_benefit']:.2f}x")
print(f"Compatible Pairs: {sharing_benefits['compatible_pairs']}")
```

The sharing benefits are expressed as multipliers (less than 1.0) that reduce memory requirements and computational overhead.

## Execution Schedule

For detailed analysis, the module generates an execution schedule with start and end times for each model:

```python
# Examining execution schedule
schedule = prediction["execution_schedule"]

print(f"Total Execution Time: {schedule['total_execution_time']:.2f} ms")

for event in schedule["timeline"]:
    print(f"{event['model']}: {event['start_time']:.2f} to {event['end_time']:.2f} ms")
```

## Integration with Web Resource Pool

The Multi-Model Execution Support module integrates with the Web Resource Pool to predict performance for browser-based concurrent model execution:

```python
# Enable Web Resource Pool integration
multi_predictor = MultiModelPredictor(
    single_model_predictor=single_predictor,
    resource_pool_integration=True
)

# Predict performance with browser-specific settings
prediction = multi_predictor.predict_multi_model_performance(
    model_configs,
    hardware_platform="webgpu",
    execution_strategy="parallel"
)
```

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Sharing Configuration

You can provide a custom configuration for cross-model tensor sharing:

```python
import json

# Create custom sharing configuration
sharing_config = {
    "text_embedding": {
        "compatible_types": ["text_embedding", "text_generation"],
        "sharing_efficiency": 0.5,
        "memory_reduction": 0.3
    },
    "vision": {
        "compatible_types": ["vision", "multimodal"],
        "sharing_efficiency": 0.4,
        "memory_reduction": 0.25
    }
}

# Save to file
with open("custom_sharing_config.json", "w") as f:
    json.dump(sharing_config, f)

# Initialize predictor with custom configuration
multi_predictor = MultiModelPredictor(
    cross_model_sharing_config="custom_sharing_config.json"
)
```

### Resource Constraints

You can specify resource constraints to simulate limited hardware environments:

```python
# Define resource constraints
resource_constraints = {
    "max_memory": 8000,  # 8 GB memory limit
    "max_compute": 0.8   # 80% of compute resources available
}

# Predict with constraints
prediction = multi_predictor.predict_multi_model_performance(
    model_configs,
    hardware_platform="cuda",
    execution_strategy="parallel",
    resource_constraints=resource_constraints
)
```
