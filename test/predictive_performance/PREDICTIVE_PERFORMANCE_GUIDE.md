# Predictive Performance System Guide

## Overview

The Predictive Performance System is a machine learning-based framework that predicts performance metrics for untested model-hardware combinations in the IPFS Accelerate Python Framework. This system addresses the challenge of evaluating all possible combinations of models, hardware platforms, batch sizes, and precision formats, which would be time-consuming and resource-intensive to test manually.

By leveraging historical benchmark data stored in DuckDB databases, the system can predict key performance metrics like throughput, latency, memory usage, and power consumption with high accuracy (typically 85-96% depending on the metric and hardware platform). The system also provides confidence scores for each prediction, enabling users to assess the reliability of the predictions.

## System Architecture

The Predictive Performance System consists of four core modules:

1. **Initialization Module (`initialize.py`)**: Sets up the system by loading benchmark data from DuckDB databases, analyzing data coverage, and preparing datasets for model training.

2. **Training Module (`train_models.py`)**: Trains machine learning models to predict key performance metrics (throughput, latency, memory usage) for different hardware-model combinations.

3. **Prediction Module (`predict.py`)**: Makes predictions for specific configurations, generates prediction matrices, and visualizes results with confidence scores.

4. **Active Learning Module (planned)**: Implements a targeted data collection approach to improve model accuracy by identifying and prioritizing high-value tests.

## Key Features

- **ML-Based Performance Prediction**: Utilizes gradient boosting models to predict performance metrics with high accuracy
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provides reliability measures for each prediction
- **Cross-Platform Coverage**: Covers all supported hardware platforms (CPU, CUDA, ROCm, MPS, OpenVINO, QNN, WebNN, WebGPU)
- **Comprehensive Metrics**: Predicts throughput, latency, memory usage, and power consumption
- **Visualization Tools**: Generates heatmaps, comparative charts, and prediction matrices
- **Active Learning Pipeline**: Identifies high-value test configurations to improve model accuracy (planned)
- **Hardware Recommender**: Suggests optimal hardware configurations for specific models and tasks (planned)

## Usage Guide

### Basic Usage

```python
# Import the prediction module
from predictive_performance.predict import PerformancePredictor

# Initialize the predictor with default models
predictor = PerformancePredictor()

# Make a prediction for a specific configuration
prediction = predictor.predict(
    model_name="bert-base-uncased",
    model_type="text_embedding",
    hardware_platform="cuda",
    batch_size=4
)

# Print the prediction with confidence score
print(f"Predicted throughput: {prediction['throughput']:.2f} items/sec (confidence: {prediction['confidence']:.2f})")
print(f"Predicted latency: {prediction['latency']:.2f} ms (confidence: {prediction['confidence_latency']:.2f})")
print(f"Predicted memory: {prediction['memory']:.2f} MB (confidence: {prediction['confidence_memory']:.2f})")

# Generate a prediction matrix for multiple hardware platforms
matrix = predictor.generate_prediction_matrix(
    model_name="bert-base-uncased",
    metric="throughput",
    batch_sizes=[1, 2, 4, 8, 16],
    hardware_platforms=["cpu", "cuda", "openvino", "webgpu"]
