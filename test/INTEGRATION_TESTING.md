# Specify custom timeout for tests
python test/integration_test_suite.py --timeout 600

# Save results to a specific file
python test/integration_test_suite.py --output ./my_integration_results.json

# Focus on hardware compatibility testing
python test/integration_test_suite.py --hardware-compatibility

```

### Using the CI Test Runner

```bash
# Run all CI tests
./test/run_integration_ci_tests.sh --all

# Run CI tests with focus on hardware compatibility
./test/run_integration_ci_tests.sh --hardware-only

# Run CI tests with focus on web platforms
./test/run_integration_ci_tests.sh --web-only
```

### Hardware Compatibility Reporting

```bash
# Collect and report compatibility issues from all components
python test/hardware_compatibility_reporter.py --collect-all

# Generate hardware compatibility matrix
python test/hardware_compatibility_reporter.py --matrix

# Test full hardware stack
python test/hardware_compatibility_reporter.py --test-hardware

# Check compatibility for a specific model
python test/hardware_compatibility_reporter.py --check-model bert-base-uncased

# Generate JSON format report
python test/hardware_compatibility_reporter.py --collect-all --format json

# Enable debug logging
python test/hardware_compatibility_reporter.py --collect-all --debug
```

## Integration Test Architecture

The integration testing system uses a hierarchical test architecture:

1. **Component Availability Detection**:
   - Check file existence for each component
   - Determine which components are available for testing
   - Adapt tests based on available components

2. **Test Categories**:
   - Hardware Detection Tests
   - Model Family Classification Tests
   - ResourcePool Tests
   - Hardware-Model Integration Tests
   - Web Platform Tests
   - Cross-Platform Tests
   - Hardware Compatibility Tests

3. **Test Execution**:
   - Run tests based on available components
   - Skip tests requiring unavailable components
   - Collect test results and errors

4. **Result Reporting**:
   - Generate comprehensive test reports
   - Provide detailed error information
   - Generate compatibility matrices

## Resilient Integration Testing

The framework implements resilient integration testing that adapts to the available components:

### Scenarios

1. **All Components Available**:
   - Run full integration tests across all components
   - Generate comprehensive compatibility matrices
   - Provide detailed error reports

2. **generators/hardware/hardware_detection.py Missing**:
   - Run limited tests with basic hardware detection
   - Use ResourcePool's fallback hardware detection
   - Skip hardware-specific integration tests

3. **model_family_classifier.py Missing**:
   - Run tests with basic model family heuristics
   - Use fallback classification based on model names
   - Skip model family integration tests

4. **Both Missing**:
   - Run core ResourcePool tests
   - Use basic device detection fallbacks
   - Skip hardware and model family integration tests

## Error Reporting

The integration testing system provides comprehensive error reporting:

### Error Categories

1. **Component Availability Errors**:
   - Missing required components
   - Import failures
   - Component initialization errors

2. **Hardware Compatibility Errors**:
   - Hardware initialization failures
   - Driver compatibility issues
   - Memory limitations

3. **Model Compatibility Errors**:
   - Model architecture incompatibilities
   - Hardware-specific model issues
   - Memory requirement issues

4. **Integration Errors**:
   - Cross-component integration failures
   - Communication failures between components
   - Resource sharing issues

### Error Reporting

The integration testing system generates detailed error reports:

```
Component: hardware_detection
Status: Available
Tests Run: 5
Tests Passed: 4
Tests Failed: 1
Errors:
- Error: Failed to initialize CUDA: CUDA driver version is insufficient for CUDA runtime version
- Recommendations:
  - Update NVIDIA drivers to the latest version
  - Check CUDA and PyTorch compatibility
```

## Best Practices

1. **Run All Components Test First**:
   - Start with a full integration test
   - Identify which components need attention
   - Focus on specific categories based on initial results

2. **Test Hardware Compatibility Early**:
   - Use hardware compatibility reporter to identify issues
   - Address hardware-specific issues before other tests
   - Ensure hardware detection is working correctly

3. **Use CI Mode for Quick Feedback**:
   - Run tests in CI mode for faster results
   - Use smaller models for quicker testing
   - Focus on specific categories when debugging

4. **Check Web Platform Compatibility Separately**:
   - Use web-specific testing options
   - Test with different browser configurations
   - Check for browser-specific compatibility issues

5. **Save Test Results for Comparison**:
   - Save test results to files for tracking
   - Compare results across different runs
   - Track compatibility changes over time

## Conclusion

The integration testing system provides a comprehensive, resilient, and adaptable approach to testing cross-component functionality in the IPFS Accelerate Python Framework. With robust error detection, reporting, and validation, the system enables thorough testing across diverse hardware environments and usage scenarios.

The integration with the hardware compatibility error reporting system ensures that developers can quickly identify and resolve issues across components, while providing clear recommendations and fallback strategies for different environments.
