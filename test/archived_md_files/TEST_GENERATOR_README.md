# IPFS Accelerate Test Generation Improvements

This directory contains improvements to the test generation system to ensure proper alignment with the ipfs_accelerate_py worker/skillset implementation structure and enable comprehensive testing across all 300+ Hugging Face model types.

## Key Files

- [template_test_generator.py](template_test_generator.py): New reference implementation for generating test files
- [generate_sample_tests.py](generate_sample_tests.py): Script to generate sample tests for different model categories
- [generate_tests_for_all_skillset_models.py](generate_tests_for_all_skillset_models.py): Script to generate tests for all models in worker/skillset

## Generated Tests

Example generated tests can be found in the following directories:

- [sample_tests/](sample_tests/): Sample tests for representative models in different categories
- [new_test_models/](new_test_models/): Test for the test_model example
- [generated_worker_tests/](generated_worker_tests/): Tests for all skillset models (if generated)

## Documentation

- [TEMPLATE_GENERATOR_README.md](TEMPLATE_GENERATOR_README.md): Comprehensive guide to the template test generator
- [RECOMMENDATION_FOR_TEST_GENERATOR.md](RECOMMENDATION_FOR_TEST_GENERATOR.md): Detailed recommendations for improving the test generator
- [SUMMARY_OF_IMPROVEMENTS.md](SUMMARY_OF_IMPROVEMENTS.md): Summary of the improvements made to the test generation system

## Integration with Existing Files

The template_test_generator.py is designed to be a reference implementation that can be used to improve the existing merged_test_generator.py file. It demonstrates the correct approach for generating test files that align with the worker/skillset implementation structure.

The key patterns implemented in the template generator should be integrated back into the merged_test_generator.py file to ensure that all generated test files properly match the required structure.

## Usage

```bash
# Generate a test for a specific model
python template_test_generator.py --model <model_name> --output-dir <output_directory>

# Generate sample tests for representative models
python generate_sample_tests.py

# Generate tests for all models in worker/skillset
python generate_tests_for_all_skillset_models.py
```

## Next Steps

1. Fix the torch tensor attribute issue in generated test files
2. Add more specialized templates for different model tasks
3. Enhance testing for real implementations where available
4. Integrate improvements back into merged_test_generator.py
