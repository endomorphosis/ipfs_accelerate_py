# API Implementation Progress Summary

## Current Status (March 1, 2025)

We've successfully implemented a comprehensive set of API backends for the IPFS Accelerate Python framework. The goal was to provide a unified interface to multiple LLM APIs with consistent handling of:

- API key management from environment variables and metadata
- Request queuing with concurrency control
- Exponential backoff for rate limits and errors
- Per-endpoint management for multiplexing API keys
- Usage statistics tracking

   - Optimize connection parameters for different API types

2. **Memory Management**
   - Implement response streaming for large response payloads
   - Add memory usage tracking and monitoring during operations
   - Implement automatic garbage collection for memory-intensive operations
   - Add batch splitting based on memory constraints and token limits

3. **Adaptive Processing**
   - Implement dynamic batch sizing based on input complexity
   - Add adaptive concurrency limits based on performance metrics
   - Create content-aware compression for large payloads
   - Implement hardware-aware optimizations for different environments

4. **Advanced Processing Features**
   - Add asynchronous versions of all API client methods
   - Implement semantic caching with similarity-based lookups
   - Add predictive prefetching for common operation sequences
   - Create performance analytics dashboards for monitoring

### Error Handling Improvements

We've also developed a comprehensive error handling framework to improve reliability:

1. **Error Classification**
   - Standardized error categories across all API backends
   - Detailed error type hierarchies for precise handling
   - Error classification with retry recommendations
   - Comprehensive error metrics collection

2. **Advanced Handling Strategies**
