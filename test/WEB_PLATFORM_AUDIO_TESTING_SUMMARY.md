The compute shader optimizations demonstrate that carefully optimized WebGPU implementations now significantly outperform WebNN for audio processing workloads, providing a compelling option for cross-platform audio model deployment. Benchmark results confirm consistent performance improvements across all major audio model types (Whisper, Wav2Vec2, CLAP), with Firefox showing exceptional performance (55% improvement), outperforming Chrome by approximately 20%. The most dramatic benefits are seen for longer audio processing tasks, where Firefox's advantage increases to approximately 24%.

Firefox's superior WebGPU compute shader implementation, activated with the `--MOZ_WEBGPU_ADVANCED_COMPUTE=1` flag, represents a significant advantage for browser-based audio AI applications. The 20% performance advantage over Chrome, coupled with better memory efficiency (5-8% reduction) and superior scaling with audio length, establishes Firefox as the recommended browser for audio model deployment.
