# Mock Detection System Implementation Summary

## Overview

The mock detection system enhances test transparency by clearly indicating when tests are using real model inference versus mock objects. This is critical for CI/CD environments where certain dependencies might be unavailable or intentionally mocked for faster testing.

## Tools Created

1. **verify_all_mock_detection.py**: Comprehensive tool for checking, fixing, and verifying mock detection across all test files
2. **fix_all_mock_checks.py**: Enhanced tool for fixing specific mock check issues in import sections
3. **verify_and_fix_all_tests.sh**: Shell script to automate the verification and fixing process for all tests
4. **run_test_with_mock_control.sh**: Utility script to run tests with different mock configurations
5. **verify_mock_detection_sample.sh**: Sample script to test verification on a small set of files
6. **ci_templates/mock_detection_ci.yml**: GitHub Actions workflow template for CI/CD integration
7. **MOCK_DETECTION_GUIDE.md**: Comprehensive documentation of the mock detection system
8. **HF_TEST_CICD_INTEGRATION.md**: Guide for integrating the mock detection system into CI/CD workflows

## Key Features Implemented

1. **Environment Variable Control**:
   - `MOCK_TORCH`: Force tests to mock PyTorch
   - `MOCK_TRANSFORMERS`: Force tests to mock Transformers
   - `MOCK_TOKENIZERS`: Force tests to mock Tokenizers
   - `MOCK_SENTENCEPIECE`: Force tests to mock SentencePiece

2. **Visual Indicators**:
   - ðŸš€ **REAL INFERENCE** (green): For tests using actual models
   - ðŸ”· **MOCK OBJECTS** (blue): For tests using mock objects for CI/CD

3. **Conditional Import Pattern**:
   ```python
   try:
       if MOCK_TORCH:
           raise ImportError("Mocked torch import failure")
       import torch
       HAS_TORCH = True
   except ImportError:
       torch = MagicMock()
       HAS_TORCH = False
       logger.warning("torch not available, using mock")
   ```

4. **Detection Logic**:
   ```python
   using_real_inference = HAS_TRANSFORMERS and HAS_TORCH
   using_mocks = not using_real_inference or not HAS_TOKENIZERS or not HAS_SENTENCEPIECE
   ```

5. **Metadata Tracking**:
   ```python
   "metadata": {
       "has_transformers": HAS_TRANSFORMERS,
       "has_torch": HAS_TORCH,
       "has_tokenizers": HAS_TOKENIZERS,
       "has_sentencepiece": HAS_SENTENCEPIECE,
       "using_real_inference": using_real_inference,
       "using_mocks": using_mocks,
       "test_type": "REAL INFERENCE" if (using_real_inference and not using_mocks) else "MOCK OBJECTS (CI/CD)"
   }
   ```

6. **Output Capture for CI/CD**:
   The `run_test_with_mock_control.sh` script now includes options to capture output to files which can be analyzed in CI/CD environments.
   ```bash
   ./run_test_with_mock_control.sh --file test_hf_bert.py --capture
   ```

## Verification Process

The verification process includes:

1. **Checking** all test files for proper mock detection implementation
2. **Fixing** any issues found using the enhanced fix script
3. **Verifying** that the fixes work properly with different environment variables
4. **Generating** a comprehensive report of the results

## Testing Results

We successfully verified and fixed the mock detection system in key test files:

1. `test_hf_bert.py`: Fixed missing mock checks for tokenizers and sentencepiece
2. `test_hf_t5.py`: Fixed missing mock checks for all dependencies
3. Verified that existing files like `test_hf_gpt2.py` and `test_hf_vit.py` already had proper mock detection

## CI/CD Integration

The mock detection system has been integrated into CI/CD workflows:

1. **GitHub Actions**: Workflow template for verifying mock detection and testing with different configurations
2. **GitLab CI**: Configuration template for validation and testing stages
3. **Jenkins**: Pipeline example with matrix-based testing of multiple configurations

The CI/CD integration follows a multi-stage approach:
1. **Syntax Validation**: Verify that all test files have the correct mock detection implementation
2. **Configuration Testing**: Test with different mock configurations to ensure flexibility
3. **Real Inference Testing**: Optional stage for environments with all dependencies available

Full details on CI/CD integration are available in `HF_TEST_CICD_INTEGRATION.md`.

## Usage Examples

### Verifying all test files:
```bash
./verify_and_fix_all_tests.sh
```

### Running a test with mock control:
```bash
# Run with all real dependencies
./run_test_with_mock_control.sh --file fixed_tests/test_hf_bert.py

# Run with all mocked dependencies
./run_test_with_mock_control.sh --file fixed_tests/test_hf_bert.py --all-mock

# Run with specific dependencies mocked
./run_test_with_mock_control.sh --file fixed_tests/test_hf_bert.py --mock-torch --mock-transformers

# Capture output to file (for CI/CD)
./run_test_with_mock_control.sh --file fixed_tests/test_hf_bert.py --capture
```

## Next Steps

1. **Apply to All Tests**: Run the verification script on all 58+ test files to ensure consistent mock detection:
   ```bash
   ./verify_and_fix_all_tests.sh
   ```

2. **CI/CD Integration**: Deploy the created workflow templates to your CI/CD system:
   ```bash
   # For GitHub Actions
   mkdir -p .github/workflows
   cp test/skills/ci_templates/mock_detection_ci.yml .github/workflows/
   ```

3. **Template Updates**: Update all test templates to include the mock detection pattern:
   ```bash
   python add_mock_detection_to_templates.py --dir templates
   ```

4. **Documentation Updates**: Keep documentation updated as the system evolves

## Conclusion

The mock detection system provides critical visibility into how tests are running, making it clear when real inference is being performed versus when mock objects are being used. With the added CI/CD integration, this system now ensures consistent test behavior across all environments, from local development to continuous integration pipelines. The enhanced visibility and control improve testing transparency and flexibility, especially in environments with variable dependency availability.
