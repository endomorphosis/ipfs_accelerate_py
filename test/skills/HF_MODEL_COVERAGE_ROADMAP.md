# HuggingFace Model Coverage Roadmap

This document outlines the plan for achieving 100% test coverage for all HuggingFace model architectures in the IPFS Accelerate Python framework.

## Current Status (March 19, 2025)

- **Total model architectures**: 315
- **Currently implemented**: 4 (1.3%)
- **Remaining to implement**: 311 (98.7%)

The current implementation covers the following core model architectures:
- BERT (encoder-only)
- GPT-2 (decoder-only)
- T5 (encoder-decoder)
- ViT (vision)

## Roadmap Timeline

## Implementation Approach

For each model, we will follow this implementation strategy:

1. **Template Selection**: Choose the appropriate architecture template
2. **Model Registry**: Create model registry with default model ID and configuration
3. **Task Type**: Configure appropriate task type (e.g., fill-mask, text-generation)
4. **Input Preparation**: Implement model-specific input preparation
5. **Pipeline Setup**: Configure pipeline parameters based on model requirements
6. **Testing**: Validate functionality with CPU and available hardware acceleration
7. **Documentation**: Update coverage tracking and roadmap

## Tooling Support

The implementation will leverage the HuggingFace Test Toolkit which provides:

```bash
# Generate tests for a batch of models
./test_toolkit.py batch 10

# Generate test for a specific model with the appropriate template
./test_toolkit.py generate roberta --template bert

# Verify functionality
./test_toolkit.py test roberta

# Track coverage
./test_toolkit.py coverage
```

## Prioritization Criteria

Models are prioritized based on:

1. **Usage Frequency**: Models commonly used in production applications
2. **Architecture Representation**: Models representing distinct architecture patterns
3. **Community Interest**: Models with high community demand or interest
4. **Resource Requirements**: Models with reasonable resource requirements for testing
5. **Implementation Complexity**: Models with straightforward implementation patterns

## Progress Tracking

Progress will be tracked using the coverage visualization tools:

```bash
./test_toolkit.py coverage

# View detailed coverage by architecture
cat coverage_visualizations/detailed_coverage_report.md
```

Weekly updates will be published in the `HF_COVERAGE_REPORT.md` file.

## Completion Criteria

Implementation of each model will be considered complete when:

1. The test file builds without syntax errors
2. The test runs successfully with the default model
3. The test includes hardware detection and appropriate device selection
4. The test implements proper error handling and reporting
5. The test is integrated into the CI/CD pipeline

## Conclusion

This roadmap provides a systematic approach to achieving 100% coverage of HuggingFace model architectures. By following the phased implementation plan and leveraging the test toolkit, we will progressively expand coverage to ensure comprehensive testing of all model types.

The implementation will prioritize high-impact models while establishing patterns for efficiently implementing the long tail of model architectures.
