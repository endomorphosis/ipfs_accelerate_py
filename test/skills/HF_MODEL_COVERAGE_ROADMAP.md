# HuggingFace Model Coverage Roadmap

> **HIGH PRIORITY OBJECTIVE:** Achieving 100% test coverage for all 300+ HuggingFace model classes with validated end-to-end testing is a high priority target. Current coverage is 100% (153/153 tracked models) - ✅ COMPLETED!

This document outlines the plan for achieving 100% test coverage for all HuggingFace model architectures in the IPFS Accelerate Python framework.

## Current Status (March 22, 2025)

- **Total Models Tracked:** 153
- **Implemented Models:** 153 (100%)
- **Missing Models:** 0 (0%)

We have successfully completed the implementation of ALL model architectures by implementing all high-priority models and all medium-priority models. Recently completed models include XClip, Speech-to-Text, ConvNextV2, BigBird, MobileNet-v2, PoolFormer, Video-LLaVA, GPT-J, GPT-NeoX, Open-LLaMA, Phi3, LayoutLM, Flan-T5, LED, LongT5, XLM-RoBERTa, CodeGen, Command-R, Gemma2/3, LLaMA-3, Mamba, Mistral-Next, Nemotron, OLMo/OLMoE, m2m_100, seamless_m4t, switch_transformers, umt5, convbert, data2vec_text, deberta_v2, esm, flaubert, ibert, CANINE, RoFormer, StableLM, MosaicMPT, Pythia, XGLM, and CodeLLama.

> **Note:** This roadmap shows 100% completion (153/153 tracked models), and our expanded tracking system in NEXT_STEPS.md also shows 100% completion (309/309 models). The expanded metric includes additional model variants and subtypes that were added to the implementation scope during development. Both metrics now show COMPLETE coverage.

The implementation now covers all major architecture categories:

### Core Models (Phase 1)
- BERT (encoder-only)

- LLaMA, Mistral, Phi, Falcon, MPT (decoder-only) 
- BART (encoder-decoder)
- Swin, DeiT, ResNet, ConvNeXT (vision)
- CLIP, BLIP, LLaVA (multimodal)
- Whisper, Wav2Vec2, HuBERT (audio)

### Architecture Expansion (Phase 3)
- XLM-RoBERTa, ELECTRA, ERNIE, RemBERT (encoder-only)
- GPT-Neo, GPT-J, OPT, Gemma (decoder-only)
- mBART, PEGASUS, ProphetNet, LED (encoder-decoder)
- BEiT, SegFormer, DETR, Mask2Former, YOLOS, SAM, DINOv2 (vision)

### Phase 2: Medium Priority Core Models (Target: May 2025)

**✅ Phase 1 Complete:** All high-priority models have been successfully implemented!

**✅ Phase 2 Complete:** Implementation of ALL medium-priority models is now COMPLETE with 153/153 models implemented (100% complete).

All models have been implemented! The last model implemented was:
1. longt5 (encoder-decoder) - Implemented on March 22, 2025

With our completion of all high-priority models and all medium-priority models, we've reached our goal of 100% coverage.

## Implementation Approach

> **CRITICAL:** Always modify generators and templates, NEVER edit generated files directly.

For each model, follow this implementation strategy:

1. **Template Selection**: Choose the appropriate architecture template
2. **Modify Generator Code**: Update `test_generator_fixed.py` to support the model
3. **Model Registry**: Add model to registry with default model ID and configuration
4. **Task Type**: Configure appropriate task type (e.g., fill-mask, text-generation)
5. **Generate Test File**: Generate test file using `test_generator_fixed.py`
6. **Validation**: Verify syntax, structure, and pipeline configuration
7. **Documentation**: Update coverage tracking and roadmap

### Example Implementation Workflow:

```bash
# 1. Look up model documentation
less /home/barberb/ipfs_accelerate_py/test/doc-builder/build/main_classes/model/qwen2.md

# 2. Modify generator to support the model
vim test_generator_fixed.py  # Add model to MODEL_REGISTRY and ARCHITECTURE_TYPES

# 3. Generate the test file
python test_generator_fixed.py --generate qwen2 --output-dir fixed_tests

# 4. Validate the generated file
python validate_model_tests.py --directory fixed_tests

# 5. Update coverage report
python generate_missing_model_report.py
```

## Tooling Support

The implementation will leverage the HuggingFace Test Toolkit which provides:

```bash
# Generate tests for a batch of models
./test_toolkit.py batch 10

# Generate test for a specific model with the appropriate template
./test_toolkit.py generate roberta --template bert

# Verify functionality
./test_toolkit.py test roberta

# Track coverage
./test_toolkit.py coverage
```

## Prioritization Criteria

Models are prioritized based on:

1. **Usage Frequency**: Models commonly used in production applications
2. **Architecture Representation**: Models representing distinct architecture patterns
3. **Community Interest**: Models with high community demand or interest
4. **Resource Requirements**: Models with reasonable resource requirements for testing
5. **Implementation Complexity**: Models with straightforward implementation patterns

## Progress Tracking

Progress will be tracked using the coverage visualization tools:

```bash
./test_toolkit.py coverage

# View detailed coverage by architecture
cat coverage_visualizations/detailed_coverage_report.md
```

Weekly updates will be published in the `HF_COVERAGE_REPORT.md` file.

## Completion Criteria

Implementation of each model will be considered complete when:

1. The test file builds without syntax errors
2. The test runs successfully with the default model
3. The test includes hardware detection and appropriate device selection
4. The test implements proper error handling and reporting
5. The test is integrated into the CI/CD pipeline

   - Validation Report: `/home/barberb/ipfs_accelerate_py/test/skills/reports/validation_report.md`

## End-to-End Validation Requirements

After implementation, the following end-to-end validation should be performed:

1. **Validation with Mock Dependencies**
   - All tests should pass with mock dependencies
   - Mock detection should properly identify missing dependencies

2. **Validation with Real Dependencies**
   - Critical priority models: 100% tested with real weights
   - High priority models: At least 50% tested with real weights
   - Medium priority models: At least 25% tested with real weights

## Conclusion

This roadmap provided a systematic approach to achieving 100% test coverage of all HuggingFace model architectures. We have SUCCESSFULLY achieved 100% coverage (153/153 models implemented).

> **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE! 🎉**
> 
> All 153 targeted model architectures have been successfully implemented and tested!

> **CRITICAL REMINDERS FOR FUTURE WORK:**
> 1. Always modify generators and templates, never edit generated files
> 2. Reference the transformers documentation at `/home/barberb/ipfs_accelerate_py/test/doc-builder/build`
> 3. Run validation after each implementation to ensure quality

By following this implementation roadmap, we have successfully implemented ALL 153 tracked models, achieving 100% coverage. The final models implemented were LED and LongT5 (both encoder-decoder architectures). We have successfully achieved our high priority objective of 100% model coverage!
