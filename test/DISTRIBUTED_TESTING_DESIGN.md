## 10. Conclusion

The distributed testing framework will significantly enhance the testing capabilities of the IPFS Accelerate Python package by enabling parallel execution across multiple machines. This will reduce the time required for comprehensive testing and enable testing on a wider variety of hardware configurations.

The phased implementation approach ensures that the system will be developed incrementally, with each phase building on the previous one. The initial implementation will focus on core functionality, with advanced features added in later phases.

This design document will serve as a guide for the implementation of the distributed testing framework, with detailed implementation plans to be developed for each phase.
