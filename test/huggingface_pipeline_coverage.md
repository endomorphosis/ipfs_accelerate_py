## Test Implementation Guidelines

When implementing new tests, follow these guidelines:

1. Use the generated templates as a starting point
2. Ensure proper handling of CPU, CUDA, and OpenVINO platforms
3. Use small model variants for testing when possible
4. Include appropriate test examples based on the model type
5. Implement robust error handling and graceful degradation
6. Report implementation type accurately (REAL vs MOCK)
7. Save and validate test results consistently
