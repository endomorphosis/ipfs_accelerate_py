## Architecture

The dashboard consists of two main components:

1. **DashboardDataProvider**: Interfaces with the DuckDB database to retrieve and process test data. It provides methods for querying different types of data including summary statistics, performance metrics, hardware comparisons, and time series data.

2. **VisualizationDashboard**: Creates and manages the Dash application, handles the UI layout, and sets up callbacks for interactivity. It organizes visualizations into tabs and provides filtering options for data exploration.

For a comprehensive description of the system architecture including component interactions, data flow, process management, and integration points, see the [System Architecture Guide](./SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Working With Test Data

The dashboard works with test results stored in the DuckDB database. The database is populated by the End-to-End Testing Framework, which stores test results, performance metrics, and hardware information.

### Database Schema

The primary tables used by the dashboard include:

- `test_results`: Test results with comprehensive metadata
- `performance_results`: Detailed performance metrics for benchmark tests
- `hardware_platforms`: Information about hardware platforms
- `models`: Information about model types and configurations

### Querying the Database

The dashboard uses SQL queries to retrieve data from the database. The `DashboardDataProvider` class handles all database interactions, providing methods for querying different types of data.

Example query for performance metrics:
```sql
SELECT tr.model_name, tr.hardware_type, 
       tr.details->>'throughput' as throughput, 
       tr.details->>'latency' as latency,
       tr.details->>'memory_usage' as memory_usage,
       tr.test_date, tr.success
FROM test_results tr
WHERE tr.model_name = :model
  AND tr.hardware_type = :hardware
ORDER BY tr.test_date DESC
```

## Best Practices

1. **Database Management**:
   - Ensure the database is regularly optimized
   - Consider using a separate database for dashboard to avoid performance impact on testing

2. **Dashboard Usage**:
   - Use filtering to focus on specific models or hardware platforms
   - Export data for offline analysis when needed
   - Use trend analysis to identify performance regressions

3. **CI/CD Integration**:
   - Generate reports as part of CI/CD pipeline
   - Use status badges to monitor test status
   - Include reports in pull request reviews

4. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Filter data at the database level rather than client-side
   - Use caching for frequently accessed data
   - Consider limiting the time range for historical data when needed

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Dashboard doesn't start**:
   - Verify that all dependencies are installed
   - Check database path and permissions
   - Look for error messages in the console

2. **No data appears in visualizations**:
   - Verify that the database exists and has data
   - Check database connection in logs
   - Try running simple queries against the database directly

3. **Dashboard is slow**:
   - Consider optimizing database queries
   - Reduce the amount of data being displayed
   - Use filtering to focus on specific subsets of data

### Debugging

For detailed debugging, run the dashboard in debug mode:

```bash
python visualization_dashboard.py --debug --verbose
```

This enables Dash's debug mode (with hot reloading) and verbose logging for the dashboard.
