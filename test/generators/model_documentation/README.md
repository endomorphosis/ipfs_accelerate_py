# Model Documentation Directory

This directory contains Markdown documentation for all model implementations across different hardware platforms. The documentation is automatically generated by the end-to-end testing framework.

## New End-to-End Testing Approach

The documentation in this directory is now part of an enhanced end-to-end testing approach where we:

1. **Generate Components Together**: Generate skill, test, and benchmark files as a unified set
2. **Run Integrated Tests**: Test all components together to ensure they work as a unit
3. **Compare with Expected Results**: Store expected outputs in `/scripts/generators/expected_results/` to compare with actual results in `/scripts/generators/collected_results/`
4. **Document Implementation**: Generate this detailed documentation to explain how components work together
5. **Fix at Generator Level**: Instead of fixing individual test files, fix the templates or generators

## Directory Structure

Each model has its own subdirectory containing implementation details for every supported hardware platform.

## Documentation Format

Each implementation document includes:

1. **Overview**: General description of the model and its implementation
2. **Model Information**: Basic model details and performance metrics
3. **Skill Implementation**: Code and explanation of the model skill class
4. **Test Implementation**: Test cases and validation methods
5. **Benchmark Implementation**: Benchmarking methodology and code
6. **Expected Results**: Expected outputs for verification
7. **Hardware-Specific Notes**: Platform-specific implementation details

## Automatic Generation

Documentation is automatically generated when running end-to-end tests:

```bash
python scripts/generators/runners/end_to_end/run_e2e_tests.py --model bert-base-uncased --hardware cpu --generate-docs
```

To generate documentation for all models across all hardware platforms:

```bash
python scripts/generators/runners/end_to_end/run_e2e_tests.py --all-models --all-hardware --generate-docs
```

## Purpose

These documentation files serve several important purposes:

1. **Understanding Model Implementations**: Help developers understand how models are implemented on different hardware
2. **Debugging Issues**: Provide context for debugging when tests fail
3. **Performance Expectations**: Document expected performance characteristics
4. **Cross-platform Reference**: Compare implementations across hardware platforms
5. **Onboarding**: Help new team members understand the model implementations

## Manual Edits

While the documentation is automatically generated, you can make manual edits to add additional information. However, note that these edits may be lost if the documentation is regenerated.

To preserve manual edits, use the following workflow:

1. Run tests with the `--generate-docs` flag
2. Make manual edits to the documentation
3. Save the edited documentation to a different location
4. When regenerating the documentation, merge your manual edits back in

Alternatively, consider enhancing the documentation generator to include your additional information automatically.
