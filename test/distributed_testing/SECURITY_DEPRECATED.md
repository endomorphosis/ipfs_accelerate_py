# SECURITY COMPONENTS DEPRECATED

## Security Features Marked as Out of Scope

As of March 16, 2025, all security and authentication features in the distributed testing framework have been marked as **OUT OF SCOPE**. These features will be handled by a separate dedicated security module outside the distributed testing framework.

### Rationale

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Security and authentication are specialized concerns that should be handled by dedicated security experts and systems.

2. **Maintainability**: By separating security concerns, both the distributed testing framework and security implementation can evolve independently.

3. **Compliance**: Security requirements often involve specific compliance standards that may differ across organizations. A separate module allows for customization based on specific needs.

4. **Expertise**: Security implementation requires specialized knowledge and ongoing maintenance to address evolving threats. This is best handled by a dedicated security team.

### Deprecated Components

The following security components are now considered out of scope for the distributed testing framework:

1. **Authentication Mechanisms**
   - API key authentication 
   - JWT token authentication
   - Message signing with HMAC
   - WebSocket authentication

2. **Security Manager**
   - Token generation and validation
   - API key management
   - Role-based access control
   - Authentication middleware

3. **Security Configuration**
   - Secret key management
   - Security settings storage
   - API key rotation
   - Token expiration settings

4. **Security Testing**
   - All tests related to authentication and authorization
   - Security verification tests
   - Authentication middleware tests
   - Token validation tests

### Code Implementation Impact

The following code components have been marked as deprecated:

1. **`security.py`**: The entire security module is now considered out of scope.
   - `SecurityManager` class
   - `auth_middleware` function
   - Token generation and validation functions
   - Message signing functions

2. **Security-related functions in coordinator.py and worker.py**
   - Authentication checks
   - Token validation
   - Role-based access checks

3. **Security-related tests**
   - `test_security.py`
   - Security-related tests in `test_coordinator.py` and `test_worker.py`

### Implementation Note

When implementing or extending the distributed testing framework, developers should:

1. **NOT** rely on the built-in security features
2. **ASSUME** that security will be provided by an external module
3. Implement components with simple mock authentication for testing purposes only
4. Refer to this document when encountering security-related code or documentation

### Testing Changes

The test runner has been updated to:

1. Skip all security-related tests
2. Use simple mocks for authentication where needed
3. Bypass security checks in test environments

### Documentation Updates

All documentation has been updated to:

1. Mark security features as out of scope
2. Reference this deprecation notice
3. Remove instructions related to security configuration
4. Update implementation status to reflect security being out of scope

### Future Work

A dedicated security module will be developed separately to handle:
- Authentication and authorization
- Secure communication
- Credential management
- Security auditing and logging
- Role-based access control
- API security best practices

This separation allows the distributed testing framework to focus on core functionality while security concerns are addressed comprehensively in a specialized module.

### Production Deployment Recommendations

For production deployments, we recommend:

1. Use an external security module or service for authentication and authorization
2. Place the distributed testing framework behind an API gateway that handles security concerns
3. Use network-level security (VPNs, firewalls, etc.) to restrict access to trusted networks
4. Implement appropriate organizational security policies for distributed testing systems
