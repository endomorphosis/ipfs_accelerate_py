# Security Implementation for Distributed Testing Framework

This document outlines the security features implemented in the distributed testing framework. These features ensure secure communication between coordinator and worker nodes, proper authentication and authorization, and protection against various threats.

## Overview

The security implementation includes:

1. **Authentication**: Ensuring that only authorized users and workers can access the framework
2. **Authorization**: Controlling what actions authorized users and workers can perform
3. **Secure Communication**: Protecting data in transit between components
4. **Message Integrity**: Ensuring messages haven't been tampered with
5. **Token Management**: Securely managing worker tokens and API keys

## Security Components

### 1. SecurityManager

The `SecurityManager` class handles security-related functionality:

- **API Key Management**: Generation and validation of API keys
- **Token Management**: Generation and validation of JWT tokens for workers
- **Message Signing**: Creating and verifying signed messages with HMAC
- **Configuration Management**: Saving and loading security configuration

### 2. Authentication Methods

The framework supports multiple authentication methods:

#### API Key Authentication

Used for initial worker registration and API access:

```
GET /api/workers
X-API-Key: <api-key>
```

#### JWT Token Authentication

Used for ongoing worker communication after registration:

```
GET /api/tasks
Authorization: Bearer <jwt-token>
```

### 3. WebSocket Authentication

WebSocket connections authenticate using:

1. Initial API key for connection establishment
2. JWT token for ongoing communication
3. Message signing for individual messages

### 4. Message Signing

All WebSocket messages are signed with HMAC:

```json
{
  "type": "heartbeat",
  "worker_id": "worker-001",
  "timestamp": 1715000000,
  "signature": "HMAC-SHA256-signature"
}
```

## Security Configuration

The security configuration can be saved to and loaded from a file:

```python
# Save configuration
security_manager.save_config("security_config.json")

# Load configuration
security_manager = SecurityManager.load_config("security_config.json")
```

This allows persistent storage of API keys and security settings between coordinator restarts.

## Best Practices

### API Key Management

- Generate unique API keys for each worker or administrator
- Assign appropriate roles to restrict permissions
- Regularly rotate API keys for security
- Store API keys securely on worker nodes

### Token Management

- Worker tokens are short-lived (default: 1 hour)
- Tokens are automatically refreshed during worker operation
- Tokens contain claims for worker identification and role-based access

### Secure Deployment

- Use TLS/SSL for all communications in production
- Run coordinator behind a reverse proxy for additional security
- Use network segmentation to isolate the testing infrastructure
- Implement proper logging and monitoring for security events

## Role-Based Access Control

The framework implements role-based access control with these roles:

- **worker**: Can register, execute tasks, and report results
- **admin**: Can manage workers, view all tasks, and configure the system
- **observer**: Can view status and results but cannot modify anything

## Integration with Coordinator and Worker

### Coordinator Integration

```python
from security import SecurityManager, auth_middleware

# Create security manager
security_manager = SecurityManager()

# Add to application
app["security_manager"] = security_manager

# Add authentication middleware
app.middlewares.append(auth_middleware)
```

### Worker Integration

```python
from security import SecurityManager

# Initialize worker with API key
worker = DistributedTestingWorker(
    coordinator_url="http://localhost:8080",
    api_key="your-api-key"
)

# Worker will automatically handle token authentication
```

## Future Enhancements

- **Certificate-based authentication**: For higher security environments
- **Fine-grained permissions**: More detailed control over specific actions
- **Audit logging**: Detailed logging of security events for compliance
- **Rate limiting**: Protection against abuse and DoS attacks
- **IP allowlisting**: Restricting access to known IP addresses
