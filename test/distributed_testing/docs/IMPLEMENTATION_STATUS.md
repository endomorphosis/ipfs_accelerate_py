## Conclusion

With the completion of Phase 5 (Fault Tolerance), the Distributed Testing Framework now provides a robust, high-performance solution for parallel test execution across heterogeneous hardware. The framework can now continue functioning correctly even in the presence of partial failures, ensuring reliable operation in production environments.

The focus has shifted to implementing Integration and Extensibility features (Phase 8) to make the framework more adaptable and interoperable with external systems. Both the Monitoring Dashboard (Phase 6) and advanced Security and Access Control features (Phase 7) have been deferred, as existing monitoring tools and security features provide adequate functionality for current deployment scenarios.
