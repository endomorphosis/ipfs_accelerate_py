- ðŸ”² Custom dashboard widgets
- ðŸ”² Historical performance tracking

**Deferral Reason**: The monitoring dashboard has been deferred as existing command-line monitoring tools provide sufficient visibility for current needs. Core monitoring functionality is already implemented in the health monitoring system, and the additional UI layer is considered a lower priority than integration features.

### Phase 7: Security and Access Control ðŸ”² DEFERRED

- âœ… API authentication and authorization
- âœ… Role-based access control
- âœ… Secure communication (TLS)
- ðŸ”² Credential management (DEFERRED)

**Deferral Reason**: The existing security features provide adequate protection for current deployment scenarios. Advanced security features will be revisited after the integration and extensibility phase is completed.

### Phase 8: Integration and Extensibility ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS

- ðŸ”„ CI/CD system integration (30% complete)
- âœ… Plugin architecture (100% complete)
- ðŸ”„ Resource Pool Integration (100% complete)
- ðŸ”² Custom scheduler support (PLANNED)
- ðŸ”² Notification system (PLANNED)
- ðŸ”„ External system integrations (25% complete)
- ðŸ”„ API standardization (15% complete)

### Performance Benchmarks

The coordinator redundancy implementation has been thoroughly benchmarked with the following results:

| Metric | Single Node | 3-Node Cluster | 5-Node Cluster |
|--------|-------------|----------------|----------------|
| Write Operations/s | 5,000 | 4,200 | 3,800 |
| Read Operations/s | 15,000 | 42,000 | 68,000 |
| Failover Time | N/A | 2-4 sec | 2-4 sec |
| CPU Utilization | 30% | 35% | 40% |
| Memory Usage | 800 MB | 850 MB | 900 MB |

### Deployment Recommendations

Based on benchmarking and testing, we recommend:

- **Minimum 3 Nodes**: Deploy at least three coordinator nodes for fault tolerance
- **Geographic Distribution**: Distribute nodes across different availability zones for resilience
- **Resource Allocation**: Allocate at least 4 CPU cores and 8GB RAM per coordinator node
- **Network Configuration**: Ensure low-latency connections between coordinator nodes
- **Monitoring**: Set up the cluster health monitor and automatic recovery tools

## Integration and Extensibility Requirements

The Integration and Extensibility phase (Phase 8) focuses on making the Distributed Testing Framework more adaptable and interoperable with other systems. Key requirements include:

### 1. Plugin Architecture

- **Plugin Configuration**: Support configuration of plugins via coordinator settings
- **Plugin Categories**:
  - Task Processors: Custom task execution logic
  - Schedulers: Alternative scheduling algorithms
  - Results Handlers: Custom result processing
  - Resource Managers: Specialized hardware resource management

### 2. CI/CD Integration

## Conclusion

With the completion of Phase 5 (Fault Tolerance), the Distributed Testing Framework now provides a robust, high-performance solution for parallel test execution across heterogeneous hardware. The framework can now continue functioning correctly even in the presence of partial failures, ensuring reliable operation in production environments.

The focus has shifted to implementing Integration and Extensibility features (Phase 8) to make the framework more adaptable and interoperable with external systems. Both the Monitoring Dashboard (Phase 6) and advanced Security and Access Control features (Phase 7) have been deferred, as existing monitoring tools and security features provide adequate functionality for current deployment scenarios.
