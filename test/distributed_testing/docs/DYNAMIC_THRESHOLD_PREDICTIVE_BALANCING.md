# Dynamic Thresholds and Predictive Load Balancing

**Date: March 13, 2025**

This document provides detailed information about the Dynamic Thresholds and Predictive Load Balancing features implemented in the Distributed Testing Framework's Adaptive Load Balancer component.

## Overview

The Adaptive Load Balancer has been enhanced with two powerful capabilities that significantly improve resource utilization and efficiency:

1. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment**: Automatically adapts load balancing thresholds based on overall system conditions
2. **Predictive Load Balancing**: Uses linear regression to forecast future load imbalances and proactively rebalance the system

These capabilities work together to create a self-tuning system that adapts to changing workloads and prevents imbalances before they occur.

## Dynamic Threshold Adjustment

### Concept

Traditional load balancers use fixed thresholds (e.g., 85% utilization = overloaded, 20% utilization = underloaded) to determine when to migrate tasks. The Dynamic Threshold Adjustment system recognizes that optimal thresholds vary based on overall system conditions:

- During **high load** periods, the system should be more aggressive in balancing
- During **low load** periods, the system should be more conservative to avoid unnecessary migrations
- When load is **increasing**, the system should prepare for potential imbalances
- When load is **decreasing**, the system should consolidate tasks efficiently

### Implementation

The Dynamic Threshold Adjustment system analyzes recent system load history to dynamically adjust the high and low thresholds:

1. **Load Trend Analysis**:
   - Uses linear regression on recent load history to determine if load is increasing, decreasing, or stable
   - Calculates trend slope to determine the rate of change
   - Categorizes trend as "increasing", "decreasing", or "stable"

2. **Adjustment Strategy**:
   - **High Load** (>75% avg utilization):
     - Lowers high threshold for more aggressive balancing
     - Raises low threshold to better balance workloads
   - **Low Load** (<30% avg utilization):
     - Raises high threshold to avoid unnecessary migrations
     - Lowers low threshold to consolidate workloads
   - **Normal Load** (30-75% avg utilization):
     - Adjusts based on trend direction

3. **Boundary Enforcement**:
   - Thresholds are constrained to reasonable bounds (high: 0.6-0.95, low: 0.1-0.4)
   - Ensures minimum separation between thresholds (at least 0.3)

### Configuration

The Dynamic Threshold Adjustment system can be configured with the following parameters:

- `enable_dynamic_thresholds`: Enable/disable dynamic threshold adjustment
- `threshold_adjustment_rate`: Rate at which thresholds are adjusted (0.0-1.0)
- `initial_threshold_high`: Initial high threshold for worker utilization
- `initial_threshold_low`: Initial low threshold for worker utilization

### Example

```python
# Enable dynamic thresholds with custom settings
load_balancer = AdaptiveLoadBalancer(
    coordinator=coordinator,
    enable_dynamic_thresholds=True,
    threshold_adjustment_rate=0.05,
    initial_threshold_high=0.85,
    initial_threshold_low=0.2
)
```

## Predictive Load Balancing

### Concept

Traditional load balancers only react to current imbalances after they occur. The Predictive Load Balancing system uses historical data to predict future imbalances and proactively rebalance the system before issues arise, providing several advantages:

- Prevents imbalances before they impact system performance
- Provides time for optimal migration planning
- Reduces the frequency of reactive migrations
- Smooths out the balancing process over time

### Implementation

The Predictive Load Balancing system uses linear regression on recent performance data to forecast future worker utilization:

1. **Data Collection**:
   - Maintains a history of worker utilization
   - Filters to relevant history (last 10 minutes)
   - Requires at least 3 data points for prediction

2. **Linear Regression**:
   - Calculates slope and intercept for each worker's utilization trend
   - Uses these parameters to predict utilization X minutes in the future
   - Calculates R-squared value to assess prediction confidence

3. **Future Imbalance Detection**:
   - Predicts system-wide metrics (avg, min, max utilization)
   - Calculates predicted imbalance score
   - Only acts on high-confidence predictions (>70%)
   - Uses slightly higher thresholds for predicted imbalances

4. **Prediction Accuracy Tracking**:
   - Evaluates previous predictions against actual values
   - Calculates mean absolute error and converts to accuracy percentage
   - Feeds accuracy metrics back to improve future predictions

### Configuration

The Predictive Load Balancing system can be configured with the following parameters:

- `enable_predictive_balancing`: Enable/disable predictive load balancing
- `prediction_window`: Window size for load prediction in minutes

### Example

```python
# Enable predictive balancing with a 5-minute prediction window
load_balancer = AdaptiveLoadBalancer(
    coordinator=coordinator,
    enable_predictive_balancing=True,
    prediction_window=5
)
```

## Cost-Benefit Analysis for Migrations

### Concept

Task migrations have associated costs (overhead, temporary performance disruption) and benefits (improved balance, better hardware matching). The Cost-Benefit Analysis system ensures migrations only occur when beneficial.

### Implementation

The system calculates costs and benefits for each potential migration:

1. **Cost Factors**:
   - Base cost for any migration (2.0)
   - Running time cost (longer-running tasks are more costly to migrate)
   - Task priority cost (higher priority tasks have higher migration costs)
   - Historical costs for similar task types

2. **Benefit Factors**:
   - Worker utilization difference (higher difference = higher benefit)
   - Hardware capability match (better hardware match = higher benefit)
   - Energy efficiency improvement (more efficient hardware = higher benefit)

3. **Decision Process**:
   - Calculate migration cost score (0-10 scale)
   - Calculate migration benefit score (0-10+ scale)
   - Calculate net benefit (benefit - cost)
   - Only proceed if net benefit > 0
   - Prioritize migrations with highest net benefit

### Configuration

Cost-Benefit Analysis can be configured with:

- `enable_cost_benefit_analysis`: Enable/disable cost-benefit analysis for migrations

## Hardware-Specific Balancing Strategies

### Concept

Different hardware types have different performance characteristics, energy efficiency, and optimal workloads. The Hardware-Specific Balancing Strategies system optimizes task placement based on hardware profiles.

### Implementation

The system maintains profiles for different hardware types:

1. **Hardware Profiles**:
   - Performance weight (relative performance)
   - Energy efficiency score
   - Thermal efficiency score

2. **Profile-Based Decisions**:
   - Uses profiles to calculate optimal hardware for different task types
   - Considers energy efficiency for power-optimized task placement
   - Adapts to specific hardware capabilities (e.g., CUDA compute capability)

3. **Worker Capability Matching**:
   - Ensures workers have required hardware for tasks
   - Calculates hardware match improvement for potential migrations
   - Considers memory requirements and specific hardware capabilities

### Configuration

Hardware-Specific Strategies can be configured with:

- `enable_hardware_specific_strategies`: Enable/disable hardware-specific balancing strategies
- `enable_resource_efficiency`: Enable/disable resource efficiency considerations

## Integration with Coordinator

The Dynamic Thresholds and Predictive Load Balancing features are integrated with the Coordinator component:

```python
# In coordinator.py
if enable_load_balancer:
    self.load_balancer = AdaptiveLoadBalancer(
        self,
        enable_dynamic_thresholds=True,
        enable_predictive_balancing=True,
        enable_cost_benefit_analysis=True,
        enable_hardware_specific_strategies=True,
        enable_resource_efficiency=True
    )
    logger.info("Adaptive load balancer initialized with dynamic thresholds and predictive balancing")
```

## Performance Metrics and Monitoring

The load balancer tracks and stores detailed metrics that can be queried for analysis:

```sql
-- Get dynamic threshold adjustments over time
SELECT timestamp, threshold_high, threshold_low, system_load
FROM load_balancer_metrics
ORDER BY timestamp DESC
LIMIT 50;

-- Analyze prediction accuracy
SELECT timestamp, prediction_accuracy, system_load
FROM load_balancer_metrics
WHERE prediction_accuracy IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY timestamp DESC
LIMIT 100;
```
