## Technical Details

### Plugin Architecture

The plugin architecture is centered around the `Plugin` abstract base class:

```python
class Plugin(abc.ABC):
    """Abstract base class for all plugins."""
    
    def __init__(self, name: str, version: str, plugin_type: PluginType):
        """Initialize plugin."""
        self.name = name
        self.version = version
        self.plugin_type = plugin_type
        self.hooks = {}
        
    def register_hook(self, hook_type: HookType, handler: Callable):
        """Register a hook handler."""
        self.hooks[hook_type] = handler
        
    @abc.abstractmethod
    async def initialize(self, coordinator) -> bool:
        """Initialize the plugin."""
        pass
        
    @abc.abstractmethod
    async def shutdown(self) -> bool:
        """Shutdown the plugin."""
        pass
```

The plugin system uses a type system to categorize plugins:

```python
class PluginType(Enum):
    """Enum of plugin types."""
    REPORTER = "reporter"
    SCHEDULER = "scheduler"
    RESOURCE_MANAGER = "resource_manager"
    NOTIFICATION = "notification"
    RESULT_HANDLER = "result_handler"
    CUSTOM = "custom"
```

### External System Interface

The external system interface provides a standardized API for all connectors:

```python
class ExternalSystemInterface(abc.ABC):
    """Abstract base class for all external system connectors."""
    
    @abc.abstractmethod
    async def initialize(self, config: Dict[str, Any]) -> bool:
        """Initialize with configuration."""
        pass
        
    @abc.abstractmethod
    async def connect(self) -> bool:
        """Establish connection."""
        pass
        
    @abc.abstractmethod
    async def is_connected(self) -> bool:
        """Check connection status."""
        pass
        
    @abc.abstractmethod
    async def execute_operation(self, operation: str, params: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Execute an operation."""
        pass
        
    # Additional required methods...
```

### CI Provider Interface

The CI provider interface standardizes CI/CD system integration:

```python
class CIProviderInterface(abc.ABC):
    """Abstract base class for all CI providers."""
    
    @abc.abstractmethod
    async def initialize(self, config: Dict[str, Any]) -> bool:
        """Initialize with configuration."""
        pass
        
    @abc.abstractmethod
    async def create_test_run(self, test_run_data: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Create a new test run."""
        pass
        
    @abc.abstractmethod
    async def update_test_run(self, test_run_id: str, update_data: Dict[str, Any]) -> bool:
        """Update a test run."""
        pass
        
    # Additional required methods...
```

## Integration Examples

### Plugin Integration Example

```python
from distributed_testing.plugin_architecture import Plugin, PluginType, HookType

class CustomPlugin(Plugin):
    """Custom plugin example."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(
            name="CustomPlugin",
            version="1.0.0",
            plugin_type=PluginType.CUSTOM
        )
        
        # Register hooks
        self.register_hook(HookType.TASK_COMPLETED, self.on_task_completed)
        
    async def initialize(self, coordinator) -> bool:
        self.coordinator = coordinator
        return True
        
    async def shutdown(self) -> bool:
        # Clean up resources
        return True
        
    async def on_task_completed(self, task_id: str, result: Any):
        # Handle task completion
        print(f"Task {task_id} completed with result: {result}")
```

### External System Connector Example (MS Teams)

```python
# Create MS Teams connector with webhook integration
teams = await ExternalSystemFactory.create_connector(
    "msteams", 
    {
        "webhook_url": "https://outlook.office.com/webhook/YOUR_WEBHOOK_URL"
    }
)

# Send a message with facts
await teams.create_item("message", {
    "title": "Test Execution Completed",
    "text": "Test execution has completed successfully.",
    "theme_color": "0078D7",  # Blue
    "facts": [
        ("Test Suite", "API Tests"),
        ("Result", "PASSED"),
        ("Duration", "10m 15s"),
        ("Failures", "0")
    ]
})

# Close the connection
await teams.close()
```

### CI Provider Example (GitHub Actions)

```python
# Create GitHub Actions provider
github = await CIProviderFactory.create_provider(
    "github",
    {
        "token": os.environ.get("GITHUB_TOKEN"),
        "repository": os.environ.get("GITHUB_REPOSITORY")
    }
)

# Create a test run
test_run = await github.create_test_run({
    "name": "API Tests",
    "build_id": os.environ.get("GITHUB_RUN_ID")
})

# Update with results
await github.update_test_run(
    test_run["id"],
    {
        "status": "completed",
        "conclusion": "success",
        "summary": {
            "total": 100,
            "passed": 98,
            "failed": 2
        }
    }
)

# Add comment to PR
if os.environ.get("GITHUB_EVENT_NAME") == "pull_request":
    pr_number = get_pr_number()
    await github.add_pr_comment(
        pr_number,
        """## Test Results
        
✅ 98/100 tests passed (98%)
⚠️ 2 tests failed

[View detailed results](http://example.com/results)
        """
    )
```
