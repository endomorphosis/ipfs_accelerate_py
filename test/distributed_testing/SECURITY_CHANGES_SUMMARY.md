# Security Features Deprecation Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to mark security and authentication features as out of scope for the distributed testing framework.

## Overview

All security and authentication features have been marked as **OUT OF SCOPE** for the distributed testing framework. These features will be handled by a separate dedicated security module outside the distributed testing framework.

## Changes Made

### New Files Created
- **SECURITY_DEPRECATED.md**: Comprehensive documentation of deprecated security features
- **SECURITY_CHANGES_SUMMARY.md**: This summary document

### Documentation Updates
1. **README.md**:
   - Updated implementation status table to mark Phase 7 (Security and Access Control) as OUT OF SCOPE
   - Removed "Secure worker node registration" from the current components list
   - Added note about security features being out of scope

2. **README_TEST_COVERAGE.md**:
   - Updated testing approach to mark security as out of scope
   - Updated test components table to mark security as out of scope
   - Updated test coverage goals to remove security coverage
   - Updated test organization principles
   - Updated guidelines for adding new tests
   - Updated troubleshooting section

3. **docs/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md**:
   - Updated phase status table to mark Phase 7 as OUT OF SCOPE
   - Replaced Phase 7 details with a note about security being out of scope
   - Updated "Comprehensive Test Coverage" section to mark security testing as out of scope
   - Updated "Secure Worker Registration" section to mark it as out of scope
   - Updated "March 2025 Update" section to mark security testing as out of scope
   - Updated "External System Integrations" section to mark authentication systems as out of scope

4. **docs/PHASE9_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md**:
   - Marked "Secure worker node registration" as OUT OF SCOPE
   - Updated focus for coming weeks to remove security tasks

5. **docs/PHASE9_TASK_TRACKER.md**:
   - Marked "Complete secure worker node registration" as OUT OF SCOPE

6. **docs/DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md**:
   - Updated documentation reference from SECURITY.md to SECURITY_DEPRECATED.md

### Code Updates
1. **run_test_distributed_framework.py**:
   - Added note about security features being out of scope
   - Modified `discover_tests()` to skip security-related tests
   - Modified `run_pytest_tests()` to skip security-related tests

## Testing Implications

The distributed testing framework will now:
- Skip all security-related tests
- Use simple mocks for authentication where needed
- Assume that security will be handled by an external module

## Future Work

A dedicated security module will be developed separately to handle:
- Authentication and authorization
- Secure communication
- Credential management
- Security auditing and logging

This separation allows the distributed testing framework to focus on core functionality while security concerns are addressed comprehensively in a specialized module.
