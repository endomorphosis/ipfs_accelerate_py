## Implementation Details

### Workload Profile

A `WorkloadProfile` encapsulates all characteristics and requirements of a workload:

```python
@dataclass
class WorkloadProfile:
    workload_id: str
    workload_type: WorkloadType
    required_backends: Set[SoftwareBackend]
    required_precisions: Set[PrecisionType]
    required_features: Set[AcceleratorFeature]
    min_memory_bytes: int
    min_compute_units: int
    metrics: Dict[WorkloadProfileMetric, float]
    # Additional properties...
```

### Execution Plan

A `WorkloadExecutionPlan` represents a plan for executing a workload:

```python
@dataclass
class WorkloadExecutionPlan:
    workload_profile: WorkloadProfile
    hardware_assignments: List[Tuple[str, HardwareCapabilityProfile]]
    is_multi_device: bool
    shard_count: int
    estimated_execution_time: float
    estimated_efficiency: float
    estimated_energy_usage: float
    execution_status: str  # planned, executing, completed, failed
    # Additional properties...
```

### Hardware Workload Manager

The central component for workload management:

```python
class HardwareWorkloadManager:
    def __init__(self, hardware_taxonomy: HardwareTaxonomy, db_path: Optional[str] = None):
        # Initialize components...
    
    def register_workload(self, workload_profile: WorkloadProfile) -> str:
        # Register a workload for scheduling...
    
    def create_execution_plan(self, workload_id: str) -> Optional[WorkloadExecutionPlan]:
        # Create an execution plan for a workload...
    
    def update_execution_status(self, workload_id: str, status: str) -> None:
        # Update the status of a workload execution...
    
    # Additional methods...
```

### Multi-Device Orchestrator

Manages complex multi-device workloads:

```python
class MultiDeviceOrchestrator:
    def __init__(self, workload_manager: HardwareWorkloadManager):
        # Initialize components...
    
    def register_workload(self, workload_id: str, config: Dict[str, Any]) -> None:
        # Register a multi-device workload...
    
    def get_ready_subtasks(self, workload_id: str) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]:
        # Get subtasks ready for execution...
    
    def record_subtask_result(self, workload_id: str, subtask_id: str, result: Any) -> None:
        # Record subtask execution result...
    
    # Additional methods...
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```python
# Initialize hardware taxonomy
taxonomy = HardwareTaxonomy()

# Register hardware profiles
cpu_profile = create_cpu_profile(...)
gpu_profile = create_gpu_profile(...)
taxonomy.register_hardware_profile(cpu_profile)
taxonomy.register_hardware_profile(gpu_profile)

# Initialize workload manager
workload_manager = HardwareWorkloadManager(taxonomy)
workload_manager.start()

# Create and register a workload profile
workload_profile = create_workload_profile(
    workload_type="vision",
    model_id="resnet50",
    min_memory_gb=4.0,
    min_compute_units=8,
    metrics={"compute_intensity": 0.8, "memory_intensity": 0.6},
    priority=2,
    preferred_hardware_class="GPU"
)

# Register the workload
workload_id = workload_manager.register_workload(workload_profile)

# Get the execution plan
plan = workload_manager.get_execution_plan(workload_id)

# Update execution status
workload_manager.update_execution_status(workload_id, "executing")
# ... perform actual execution ...
workload_manager.update_execution_status(workload_id, "completed")

# Stop the workload manager when done
workload_manager.stop()
```

### Multi-Device Orchestration

```python
# Initialize orchestrator
orchestrator = MultiDeviceOrchestrator(workload_manager)

# Register a multi-device workload
workload_config = {
    "name": "Multi-Device LLM Inference",
    "aggregation_method": "concat",
    "subtasks": {
        "tokenize": {...},  # Subtask configuration
        "encode": {...},    # Subtask configuration with dependencies
        "generate": {...},  # Subtask configuration with dependencies
        "postprocess": {...} # Subtask configuration with dependencies
    }
}
orchestrator.register_workload("multi_device_workload", workload_config)

# Process ready subtasks
ready_subtasks = orchestrator.get_ready_subtasks("multi_device_workload")
for subtask in ready_subtasks:
    # Create and register workload for subtask
    # Execute subtask
    # Record result
    orchestrator.record_subtask_result("multi_device_workload", subtask["subtask_id"], result)

# Get final results
if orchestrator.is_workload_completed("multi_device_workload"):
    results = orchestrator.get_aggregated_results("multi_device_workload")
```

## Integration with Distributed Testing Framework

The Hardware-Aware Workload Management system integrates with other components of the Distributed Testing Framework:

Specialized integration with browser-based hardware acceleration:

```python
# Create browser-specific workload profiles
browser_workload = create_workload_profile(
    workload_type="vision",
    model_id="vit-base",
    preferred_hardware_class="HYBRID",
