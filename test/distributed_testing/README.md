# Distributed Testing Framework

> **ðŸŽ‰ MILESTONE ACHIEVED: Integration and Extensibility Phase (Phase 8) completed successfully on May 27, 2025! [Read the completion report](docs/INTEGRATION_EXTENSIBILITY_COMPLETION.md)**

## Overview

The Distributed Testing Framework provides a robust solution for executing tests across distributed hardware environments with a focus on AI model performance and compatibility testing. It enables parallel execution, intelligent scheduling, and comprehensive reporting while integrating with existing CI/CD pipelines and external systems.

## Key Features

- **Distributed Test Execution**: Run tests across multiple worker nodes for parallel execution
- **Intelligent Scheduling**: Schedule tests based on hardware requirements and capabilities
- **Fault Tolerance**: Handle worker failures and task recovery
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generate detailed reports with benchmark metrics
- **Resource Management**: Efficiently manage hardware resources
- **CI/CD Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with CI/CD pipelines
- **External System Integration**: Connect with JIRA, Slack, TestRail, and more
- **Plugin Architecture**: Extend functionality through plugins
- **WebGPU/WebNN Integration**: Leverage browser-based hardware acceleration

## Architecture

The framework consists of the following components:

- **Coordinator**: Central component that manages workers and schedules tasks
- **Workers**: Nodes that execute tests on specific hardware
- **Plugins**: Extensible components for adding functionality
- **Resource Pool**: Manages hardware resources for optimal utilization
- **External System Connectors**: Integrates with various external systems
- **CI/CD Providers**: Connects with CI/CD systems for reporting

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- PostgreSQL (for production) or SQLite (for development)
- Redis (optional, for improved performance)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-org/distributed-testing-framework.git
cd distributed-testing-framework

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Initialize the database
python -m distributed_testing.init_db
```

### Basic Usage

1. **Start the coordinator**:

```bash
python -m distributed_testing.coordinator --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

2. **Register workers**:

```bash
python -m distributed_testing.worker --coordinator-url http://coordinator:8000 --hardware-config hardware.json
```

3. **Submit tasks**:

```bash
python -m distributed_testing.submit_task --coordinator-url http://coordinator:8000 --task-file task.json
```

## Integration Examples

### Plugin Integration

```python
from distributed_testing.plugin_architecture import Plugin, PluginType, HookType

class MyReporterPlugin(Plugin):
    """Custom reporter plugin."""
    
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(
            name="MyReporter",
            version="1.0.0",
            plugin_type=PluginType.REPORTER
        )
        
        # Register hooks
        self.register_hook(HookType.TASK_COMPLETED, self.on_task_completed)
        
    async def initialize(self, coordinator) -> bool:
        """Initialize the plugin."""
        self.coordinator = coordinator
        self.results = []
        return True
        
    async def on_task_completed(self, task_id: str, result: Any):
        """Handle task completed event."""
        self.results.append({
            "task_id": task_id,
            "result": result,
            "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat()
        })
```

### External System Integration

```python
from distributed_testing.external_systems import ExternalSystemFactory

# Create JIRA connector
jira = await ExternalSystemFactory.create_connector(
    "jira", 
    {
        "email": "user@example.com",
        "token": "api_token",
        "server_url": "https://jira.example.com",
        "project_key": "PROJECT"
    }
)

# Create an issue
issue = await jira.create_item("issue", {
    "summary": "Test Issue",
    "description": "This is a test issue",
    "issue_type": "Bug",
    "priority": "Medium"
})
```
