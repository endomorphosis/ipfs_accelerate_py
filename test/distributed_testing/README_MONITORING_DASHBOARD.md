# Real-time Monitoring Dashboard

## Overview

The Real-time Monitoring Dashboard provides a comprehensive and interactive interface for monitoring the Distributed Testing Framework's runtime health, worker nodes, task execution, hardware utilization, and network connectivity.

This feature completes the final component of the Distributed Testing Framework by providing essential real-time visibility into the system's operation. With this dashboard, users can monitor cluster health, track worker node performance, visualize task execution, and ensure optimal resource utilization across the testing infrastructure.

## Features

- **Cluster Status Overview**: Real-time metrics on cluster health, active workers, tasks, and success rate
- **Resource Usage Visualization**: Interactive charts for CPU and memory usage
- **Worker Node Management**: Search and filter worker nodes with hardware capability indicators
- **Task Queue Monitoring**: Track tasks with status filtering
- **Network Connectivity Visualization**: Interactive D3.js network graph
- **Hardware Availability**: Monitor available hardware types across your worker fleet
- **WebSocket Support**: True real-time updates via WebSocket with automatic fallback to polling
- **Auto-refresh**: Configurable refresh intervals for real-time updates

## Implementation Details

The implementation includes:

1. **Frontend Components**:
   - Dashboard HTML template with responsive design
   - Chart.js integration for data visualization
   - D3.js network graph for topology visualization
   - Search and filter capabilities for workers and tasks
   - WebSocket integration for real-time data updates
   - Auto-refresh mechanism with configurable intervals (fallback for when WebSocket is unavailable)

2. **Backend API Endpoints**:
   - `/api/monitoring/cluster`: Cluster status metrics
   - `/api/monitoring/workers`: Worker node information
   - `/api/monitoring/tasks`: Task queue data
   - `/api/monitoring/resources`: Resource usage data
   - `/api/monitoring/hardware`: Hardware availability data
   - `/api/monitoring/network`: Network topology data

3. **WebSocket Implementation**:
   - Flask-SocketIO integration for real-time communication
   - Room-based subscriptions for monitoring updates
   - Background thread for periodic data broadcasting
   - Manual refresh capability via WebSocket events
   - Automatic fallback to polling when WebSocket is unavailable

4. **Integration with Existing Systems**:
   - Flask route for the monitoring dashboard page
   - Integration with existing web dashboard authentication
   - Integration with the sidebar navigation menu

## Getting Started

To access the Real-time Monitoring Dashboard:

1. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install flask flask-cors flask-socketio
   ```

2. Start the web dashboard with WebSocket support:
   ```bash
   python run_web_dashboard.py --update-interval 5
   ```
   The `--update-interval` parameter specifies how frequently (in seconds) the WebSocket will broadcast updates to connected clients.

3. Navigate to the monitoring dashboard:
   ```
   http://localhost:8050/monitoring
   ```

4. Log in with the default credentials:
   - Username: `admin` or `user`
   - Password: `admin_password` or `user_password`

5. Verify WebSocket connection:
   - When WebSocket is active, you'll see a "WebSocket Connected" indicator replacing the auto-refresh controls
   - If WebSocket is unavailable, the dashboard will automatically fall back to the polling-based approach

## Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements include:
1. âœ… WebSocket support for real-time updates (Completed March 16, 2025)
2. Customizable dashboard layouts
3. Historical view with time range selection
4. Custom alert configuration
5. Mobile optimization

## Implementation Status

**Initial Implementation Complete: March 16, 2025**
**WebSocket Integration Complete: March 16, 2025**

With the completion of the Real-time Monitoring Dashboard and WebSocket integration, the Distributed Testing Framework now provides comprehensive capabilities for test distribution, execution, result aggregation, analysis, and real-time monitoring. This completes the full suite of features required for production deployment and operation of the framework.

## Technical Benefits of WebSocket Integration

The WebSocket integration provides several key technical benefits:

1. **Reduced Latency**: Updates are pushed immediately to the client rather than requiring polling
2. **Decreased Server Load**: Eliminates the constant HTTP requests from polling
3. **Lower Bandwidth Usage**: Only sends data when it changes, rather than repeatedly fetching the same information
4. **Better User Experience**: More responsive interface with true real-time updates
5. **Graceful Degradation**: Automatic fallback to polling when WebSocket is unavailable
6. **Connection Status Awareness**: Visual indicators show when using WebSocket vs. polling
