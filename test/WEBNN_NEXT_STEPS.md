# WebNN Backend Implementation - Next Steps

**Date:** March 15, 2025  
**Status:** In Progress - 70% complete  
**Target Completion:** May 31, 2025

## Overview

This document outlines the next steps required to complete the TypeScript SDK Implementation for WebGPU/WebNN following the successful implementation of the WebNN backend. The WebNN backend provides hardware acceleration for neural network operations in web browsers using the WebNN API, with a focus on performance, browser compatibility, and ease of use.

## Completed Items

The following components of the WebNN backend have been completed:

- ✅ Core WebNN backend implementation following the Hardware Abstraction Layer interface
- ✅ Tensor operations and management (creation, reading, garbage collection)
- ✅ Matrix multiplication, elementwise operations (relu, sigmoid, tanh), softmax, and convolution
- ✅ Graph-based computation with caching for improved performance
- ✅ Memory management with automatic garbage collection
- ✅ Browser-specific optimizations, especially for Edge which has superior WebNN support
- ✅ Simulation detection to identify hardware vs. simulated implementations
- ✅ Standalone WebNN interface for easier usage without requiring the full HAL
- ✅ Browser recommendation system for optimal WebNN usage
- ✅ Performance tier detection based on browser capabilities
- ✅ Example runner with detailed performance metrics
- ✅ Interactive browser example with WebNN feature testing
- ✅ Comprehensive testing suite for WebNN operations and standalone interface
