# WebNN Implementation Next Steps

This document outlines the next steps for continuing development of the WebNN-based tensor operations for the TypeScript SDK.

## Completed Implementation

We have successfully implemented the WebNN backend with the following components:

- ✅ WebNN backend class implementing the HardwareBackend interface
- ✅ Graph-based neural network computation for tensor operations
- ✅ WebNN features and capabilities detection across browsers
- ✅ Hardware acceleration and neural processor detection
- ✅ Multi-backend support with fallback between WebGPU and WebNN
- ✅ Example application demonstrating WebNN capabilities

## Next Steps

### 1. Advanced Graph Optimization (Target: April 5, 2025)

The current WebNN implementation creates a new graph for each operation. We can significantly improve performance by implementing graph optimization:

- [ ] Implement operation fusion to combine multiple operations in a single graph
- [ ] Create a graph caching system to reuse graph structures
- [ ] Add constant folding for operations with constant inputs
- [ ] Implement shape inference to avoid redundant reshape operations
- [ ] Add graph compilation for frequently used operation sequences

### 2. Browser-Specific Optimizations (Target: April 10, 2025)

Different browsers have different WebNN implementations. We can optimize for each:

- [ ] Create Chrome-specific optimizations for neural operations
- [ ] Implement Safari-specific optimizations for Apple Neural Engine
- [ ] Add Edge-specific optimizations for DirectML acceleration
- [ ] Create Firefox-specific optimizations for experimental WebNN
- [ ] Implement fallback mechanisms for unsupported operations in each browser

### 3. Neural Processor Acceleration (Target: April 15, 2025)

Devices with neural processors (NPUs) can provide significant performance improvements:

- [ ] Add detailed NPU detection for Apple Silicon, Qualcomm, Samsung, MediaTek
- [ ] Implement NPU-specific graph structures for better acceleration
- [ ] Create power-efficiency modes for mobile NPUs
- [ ] Add specialized operations for quantized execution on NPUs
- [ ] Implement hardware-specific inference optimizations

### 4. WebNN Model Implementation (Target: April 25, 2025)

Implement complete ML models using WebNN acceleration:

- [ ] Create BERT implementation using WebNN graph API
- [ ] Implement ViT (Vision Transformer) with WebNN acceleration
- [ ] Add Whisper speech recognition model with WebNN backend
- [ ] Create text embedding models for efficient encodings
- [ ] Implement model tokenization and preprocessing

### 5. Tensor Sharing with WebNN (Target: April 30, 2025)

Integrate SharedTensor implementation with WebNN backend:

- [ ] Extend SharedTensor to support WebNN graph tensors
- [ ] Implement reference counting for WebNN operands
- [ ] Create zero-copy tensor views for WebNN graphs
- [ ] Add tensor sharing manager integration with WebNN
- [ ] Implement cross-model memory optimization across WebGPU and WebNN

### 6. Comprehensive Performance Benchmarking (Target: May 5, 2025)

Create a detailed benchmarking suite for WebNN performance:

- [ ] Implement benchmarking for all tensor operations
- [ ] Create cross-browser performance comparisons
- [ ] Add hardware-specific benchmarking (NPU vs GPU vs CPU)
- [ ] Implement power consumption benchmarks for mobile devices
- [ ] Create visualization tools for performance analysis
