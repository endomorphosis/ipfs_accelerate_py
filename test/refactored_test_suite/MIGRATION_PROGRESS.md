### Directory Structure Status

The following directories have been created and populated with tests:

- `refactored_test_suite/api/`
- `refactored_test_suite/browser/`

## Next Steps

1. **Continue Fixing Import Path Issues**: Update the imports in test files to use absolute imports instead of relative imports:
   - ✅ WebGPU/WebNN test import paths fixed (using absolute imports)
   - ✅ BERT base model test import paths fixed (using absolute imports)
   - Other model tests need fixed import paths

2. **Continue Model Tests Migration**:
   - ✅ Added VIT model test (`test_vit-base-patch16-224.py`) as properly structured ModelTest class
   - ✅ Added T5 model test (`test_hf_t5.py`) as properly structured ModelTest class
   - ✅ Added Llama/OPT model test (`test_llama.py`) as properly structured ModelTest class with multi-platform support
   - ✅ Added CLAP model test (`test_hf_clap.py`) as properly structured ModelTest class for audio-text models
   - ✅ Added Whisper model test (`test_hf_whisper.py`) as properly structured ModelTest class for speech recognition
   - ✅ Added CLIP model test (`test_hf_clip.py`) as properly structured ModelTest class for vision-text models
   - ✅ Added DETR model test (`test_hf_detr.py`) as properly structured ModelTest class for object detection models
   - ✅ Added Wav2Vec2 model test (`test_hf_wav2vec2.py`) as properly structured ModelTest class for speech recognition
   - ✅ Added LLaVA model test (`test_hf_llava.py`) as properly structured ModelTest class for image-to-text generation
   - ✅ Added Qwen2 model test (`test_hf_qwen2.py`) as properly structured ModelTest class for large language model text generation
   - ✅ Added XCLIP model test (`test_hf_xclip.py`) as properly structured ModelTest class for extended image-text models
   - ✅ Completed migration of all prioritized model tests
   - Consider creating automatic conversion tool for remaining model tests

3. **Migrate More Tests**: Continue migrating tests from the following categories:
   - Continue with Model tests (focus on T5, etc.)
   - Then Hardware tests (WebGPU, WebNN)
   - Finally additional API and Browser tests

4. **Improve Test Runner**: Enhance the existing `run_refactored_test_suite.py` script to handle test dependencies better and generate more detailed reports.

5. **CI/CD Integration**: Set up CI/CD to run tests in both the original and refactored structures.

## Usage Guide

To continue the migration, use the `migrate_tests.py` script:

```bash
# Migrate all test files (with a limit to avoid processing too many at once)
python migrate_tests.py --limit 10

# Migrate specific files
python migrate_tests.py --files path/to/test_file1.py path/to/test_file2.py

# Do a dry run first to see what would happen
python migrate_tests.py --dry-run --limit 10

# Generate a report of the migration
python migrate_tests.py --report custom_report.md --limit 10
```

To run the refactored tests:

```bash
# Run all refactored tests with proper import path handling
python run_refactored_test_suite.py --init

# Run tests in a specific directory
python run_refactored_test_suite.py --subdirs api models/text

# Generate a detailed report
python run_refactored_test_suite.py --output custom_report.md
```

The new test runner `run_refactored_test_suite.py` provides proper import path handling and better error reporting.

## Issues and Solutions

### Syntax Errors in Source Files

Some source files have syntax errors that prevent AST parsing. The migration tool has been updated to handle this by:
1. Adding a warning comment to the file
2. Copying the file without transformation
3. Marking it for manual review and fixing

We've addressed 3 of these files by manually fixing the syntax errors and implementing the proper base class methods. The remaining files with syntax errors should be fixed using the same approach.

### Class Structure Conversion

When transforming procedural test functions into class-based tests, we follow this pattern:

1. Import the appropriate base class
2. Create a test class that inherits from the base class
3. Move setup code into `setUp` method
4. Move cleanup code into `tearDown` method
5. Convert each test function to a test method
6. Add assertions using the base class's utilities

### Asynchronous Tests

For tests that use `async`/`await`, we need to take special care:

1. Keep the async methods but wrap them in synchronous test methods when needed
2. Use `asyncio.run()` to execute async code from synchronous test methods
3. Ensure proper cleanup of async resources
