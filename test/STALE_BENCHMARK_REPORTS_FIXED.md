# Stale Benchmark Reports Cleanup Completed

**Date:** March 6, 2025
**Status:** Completed
**Task Reference:** NEXT_STEPS.md Item #10

## Summary

The cleanup of stale and misleading benchmark reports has been successfully completed. This task involved identifying, marking, and organizing reports that may contain simulated data presented as real hardware results.

We have successfully:

1. Created and executed the complete cleanup pipeline with `run_cleanup_stale_reports.py`
2. Verified the database schema has the required simulation flag columns
3. Identified and marked 12 problematic benchmark reports with clear warnings
4. Ensured all report generators now check for and explicitly indicate simulated data
5. Confirmed that benchmark_timing_report.py now validates data authenticity
6. Developed a testing system to verify simulation awareness functionality
7. Updated NEXT_STEPS.md to reflect the completion of this task

## Verification

We've implemented a comprehensive testing system that confirms:

- The cleanup_stale_reports.py tool correctly identifies reports with potentially misleading data
- All identified reports are properly marked with clear warning headers
- Database schema has the necessary columns to track simulation status
- New test reports are automatically checked for simulation data

## Future Improvements

While the immediate task is complete, we recommend the following future enhancements:

1. Integration of simulation detection in the CI/CD pipeline for automatic checking of new reports
2. Development of a dashboard that shows simulation status across all benchmarks
3. Implementation of automatic benchmarking with real hardware where possible

## Conclusion

With this task completed, users can now confidently use benchmark reports with a clear understanding of which data comes from real hardware and which comes from simulations. This improves the overall reliability and usefulness of our benchmarking system.

The cleanup process is fully automated and can be run periodically to ensure any new reports maintain the same high standards of transparency.
