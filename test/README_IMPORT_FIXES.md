# IPFS Accelerate Import Path Fixes

This directory contains tools and documentation for fixing import path issues in the IPFS Accelerate codebase after the March 2025 reorganization.

## Background

The codebase has been reorganized with files moved from `/test/` to:
- `/generators/` - Code generation tools (216 files)
- `/duckdb_api/` - Database functionality (83 files)

This reorganization caused import path issues that need to be addressed.

## Tools and Documentation

### Testing and Diagnostic Tools

- **`create_init_files.py`** - Creates missing `__init__.py` files in package directories
- **`test_package_imports.py`** - Tests importing packages and modules
- **`fix_syntax_errors.py`** - Scans Python files for syntax errors

### Documentation

- **`IMPORT_PATH_SETUP.md`** - Guide for setting up import paths
- **`PATH_FIXES_README.md`** - Overview of changes made
- **`REORGANIZATION_TESTING_REPORT.md`** - Detailed testing report

## Quick Start

1. **Ensure all directories have `__init__.py` files**:
   ```bash
   python create_init_files.py
   ```

2. **Test package imports**:
   ```bash
   python test_package_imports.py
   ```

3. **Check for syntax errors**:
   ```bash
   python fix_syntax_errors.py
   ```

4. **Set up PYTHONPATH** (from project root):
   ```bash
   export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/ipfs_accelerate_py
   ```

## Issues Found and Status

### Resolved Issues ✅

- Added missing `__init__.py` files to ensure proper package structure
- Created comprehensive documentation for import path setup
- Created testing tools to verify package structure
- Verified basic script execution functionality

### Pending Issues ❌

- 15 files in the `duckdb_api` package have syntax errors
- Import path configuration needs to be implemented project-wide
- Some files likely still use old import patterns
- Dependencies need to be documented and installed

## Next Steps

1. Fix syntax errors in the identified files
2. Update import statements to use the new package structure
3. Install required dependencies
4. Create a pull request with all fixes
5. Update CI/CD pipelines to use the new paths
