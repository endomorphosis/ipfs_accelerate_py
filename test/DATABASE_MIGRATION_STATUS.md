## Conclusion

The migration of benchmark scripts and test generators to the DuckDB database system is now complete. All targeted scripts have been successfully migrated or archived. The new system provides significant improvements in performance, analysis capabilities, data integrity, and usability.

The implementation of the IPFS Test Results Migration Tool (`migrate_ipfs_test_results.py`) represents a significant achievement in this migration process. This specialized tool provides comprehensive capabilities for migrating legacy IPFS test results to the DuckDB database, with features for validation, deduplication, archiving, and reporting. The accompanying testing framework (`test_ipfs_migration.py`) ensures the tool's reliability and correctness.

The integration of the Integrated Skillset Generator with the database template system marks an important milestone in our effort to standardize template management and ensure consistent implementation patterns across all models.

With the completion of this migration, we have fully deprecated JSON output in favor of structured database storage, enabling more sophisticated analysis capabilities and significantly improving the maintainability of our test framework.

The implementation of the fixed benchmark query tool and enhanced report generation capabilities further improves the usability and reliability of the database system.

Future work will focus on enhancing the system with additional features, optimizing performance, and expanding the capabilities of our template-based generation system. The IPFS migration tool provides a foundation for further development of specialized migration tools for other components of the framework.
