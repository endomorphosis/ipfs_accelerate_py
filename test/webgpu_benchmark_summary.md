# WebGPU Benchmark Results for 13 High-Priority Models

## Results Summary
- Ran benchmarks for all 13 high-priority HuggingFace model classes
- Used WebGPU with simulation mode (real hardware not available)
- Database path: ./benchmark_db.duckdb
- All results stored directly in the database
- Applied March 2025 optimizations:
  - Compute Shaders (for audio models)
  - Parallel Loading (for multimodal models)
  - Shader Precompilation

## Model Classes Tested
1. BERT
2. T5 
3. LLAMA
4. CLIP
5. ViT
6. CLAP
7. Whisper
8. Wav2Vec2
9. LLaVA
10. LLaVA-Next
11. XCLIP
12. Qwen2/3
13. DETR

## Quantization Testing
- Tested 4-bit quantization for LLMs
- Compared performance across quantization levels (FP16, INT8, INT4, INT2)
- Memory reduction with 4-bit: ~75%
- Performance impact varies by model type

## Key Findings
- Text models (BERT, T5) perform well with WebGPU and 4-bit quantization
- Vision models (ViT, CLIP) show good performance with shader precompilation
- Audio models benefit from compute shader optimizations
- Multimodal models benefit from parallel loading optimization
- Large models (LLaMA, LLaVA) show significant memory savings with quantization

## Next Steps
For real hardware testing:
1. Test with Chrome for general WebGPU support
2. Test with Edge for best WebNN support  
3. Test with Firefox for optimal audio model performance
4. Compare performance across different quantization levels
5. Validate with real browser testing (not simulation)

All test results are stored in the DuckDB database for detailed analysis.
