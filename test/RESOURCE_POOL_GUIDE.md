## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from resource_pool import get_global_resource_pool

# Get the global resource pool instance
pool = get_global_resource_pool()

# Get or create a resource 
torch = pool.get_resource("torch", constructor=lambda: __import__("torch"))
transformers = pool.get_resource("transformers", constructor=lambda: __import__("transformers"))

# Get or create a model with hardware awareness
model = pool.get_model(
    "embedding", 
    "bert-base-uncased", 
    constructor=lambda: transformers.AutoModel.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased"),
    hardware_preferences={"device": "auto"}  # Automatically select optimal device
)

# Get or create a tokenizer
tokenizer = pool.get_tokenizer(
    "embedding", 
    "bert-base-uncased",
    constructor=lambda: transformers.AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")
)

# Get resource pool usage statistics
stats = pool.get_stats()
print(f"Resource pool stats: {stats}")

# Clean up unused resources (resources not accessed in the last 30 minutes)
pool.cleanup_unused_resources(max_age_minutes=30)

# Or clear all resources
pool.clear()
```

### Integration with Test Generator

The ResourcePool is deeply integrated with the test generator workflow, providing intelligent resource allocation and hardware selection during test generation and execution. The test generator creates test files that automatically use the ResourcePool with hardware-aware model loading.

#### Generating Tests with Hardware Awareness

```bash
# Generate a hardware-aware test file for bert-base-uncased
python generators/models/test_generator_with_resource_pool.py --model bert-base-uncased --output-dir ./skills

# Generated tests include hardware-aware resource handling:
# - Automatic device selection based on model family
# - Memory-efficient model loading with hardware compatibility checks
# - Proper resource cleanup and memory management
# - Hardware-specific test cases optimized for available hardware
# - WebNN/WebGPU compatibility for web-based deployment scenarios
```

#### Advanced Test Generator Options

```bash
# Generate with debug logging to see detailed resource allocation
python generators/models/test_generator_with_resource_pool.py --model bert-base-uncased --debug

# Clear the resource cache before generating
python generators/models/test_generator_with_resource_pool.py --model bert-base-uncased --clear-cache

# Set a custom timeout for resource cleanup
python generators/models/test_generator_with_resource_pool.py --model bert-base-uncased --timeout 60

# Use the model family classifier to optimize test generation
python generators/models/test_generator_with_resource_pool.py --model bert-base-uncased --use-model-family

# Force a specific hardware backend
python generators/models/test_generator_with_resource_pool.py --model bert-base-uncased --device cuda

# Use hardware detection cache to speed up generation
python generators/models/test_generator_with_resource_pool.py --model bert-base-uncased --hw-cache ./hardware_cache.json

# Specify model database for improved classification
python generators/models/test_generator_with_resource_pool.py --model bert-base-uncased --model-db ./model_database.json
```

#### How Tests Use ResourcePool

The generated test files use the ResourcePool in the following ways:

1. **Efficient Resource Sharing**: Models and tokenizers are loaded only once per test class
2. **Hardware-Aware Loading**: Automatic hardware detection and optimal device selection based on model family
3. **Memory-Efficient Execution**: Models are moved to the appropriate device only when needed
4. **Proper Cleanup**: Test classes include proper cleanup in teardown methods
5. **Comprehensive Statistics**: Tests output resource usage statistics when complete
6. **Multi-GPU Management**: Distribution of models across available GPUs for parallel processing
7. **Dynamic Hardware Fallback**: Graceful fallback to alternative hardware when preferred device is unavailable
8. **Memory Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of memory usage with automatic optimizations
9. **Model Family Optimization**: Specialized handling based on model family characteristics
10. **WebNN/WebGPU Support**: Integration with web-based deployment platforms for cross-platform testing

## Thread Safety

The ResourcePool is thread-safe and can be used in multi-threaded environments. All resource access is protected by a thread lock to ensure consistency.

## Hardware Awareness and Intelligent Device Selection

The ResourcePool integrates with the hardware_detection module to automatically determine the optimal device for models based on their characteristics and available hardware. This integration uses model family classification to make intelligent decisions about resource allocation.

### Automatic Hardware Selection

```python
from resource_pool import get_global_resource_pool
from transformers import AutoModel

# Get resource pool - hardware detection happens automatically
pool = get_global_resource_pool()

# Define model constructor - the pool will decide optimal device
def create_model():
    return AutoModel.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")

# The ResourcePool automatically detects hardware capabilities,
# classifies the model family, and chooses the optimal device
model = pool.get_model(
    "embedding",  # Model family helps optimize hardware selection
    "bert-base-uncased", 
    constructor=create_model
)

# The selected device is logged during model loading:
# "Selected optimal device for embedding:bert-base-uncased: cuda:0"
```

### Advanced Hardware Selection

```python
from resource_pool import get_global_resource_pool
from hardware_detection import detect_available_hardware

# Get comprehensive hardware information
hardware_info = detect_available_hardware()

# Create hardware-aware preferences with specific needs
hardware_preferences = {
    "priority_list": ["cuda", "mps", "cpu"],  # Hardware priority order
    "preferred_index": 0,                     # Use primary GPU
    "precision": "fp16",                     # Use mixed precision when available
    "hw_compatibility": {
        "cuda": {"compatible": True, "memory_usage": {"peak": 500}},
        "mps": {"compatible": True},
        "openvino": {"compatible": True}
    }
}

# Load model with these specific hardware preferences
pool = get_global_resource_pool()
model = pool.get_model(
    "embedding",
    "bert-base-uncased",
    constructor=lambda: AutoModel.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased"),
    hardware_preferences=hardware_preferences
)
```

### Manual Hardware Preferences

```python
from hardware_detection import detect_available_hardware, CUDA, CPU, MPS, OPENVINO
from resource_pool import get_global_resource_pool
from transformers import AutoModel

# Get comprehensive hardware information
hw_info = detect_available_hardware()
best_device = hw_info["torch_device"]

# Get resource pool
pool = get_global_resource_pool()

# Set hardware preferences to override automatic selection
hardware_preferences = {
    "device": best_device,
    "force_device": True,  # Skip compatibility checks
    "precision": "fp16"    # Request mixed precision if available
}

# Pass hardware preferences to override automatic device selection
model = pool.get_model(
    "embedding", 
    "bert-base-uncased", 
    constructor=lambda: AutoModel.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased"),
    hardware_preferences=hardware_preferences
)

# You can also request device-specific versions:
cpu_model = pool.get_model(
    "embedding", 
    "bert-base-uncased", 
    constructor=lambda: AutoModel.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased"),
    hardware_preferences={"device": "cpu"}
)

# Or use the hardware constants for more reliable selection:
cuda_model = pool.get_model(
    "embedding", 
    "bert-base-uncased", 
    constructor=lambda: AutoModel.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased"),
    hardware_preferences={"priority_list": [CUDA, CPU]}
)

# The pool maintains separate instances for each unique hardware configuration
```

### Smart Model Family Based Decisions

The ResourcePool's device selection logic considers model family characteristics with comprehensive hardware compatibility matrix:

| Model Family | CUDA | ROCm (AMD) | MPS (Apple) | OpenVINO | WebNN | WebGPU | Special Handling |
|--------------|------|------------|-------------|----------|-------|--------|------------------|
| Text Generation (LLMs) | ✅ High | ✅ Medium | ✅ Medium | ✅ Low | ✅ Low* | ✅ Low* | Memory requirements checked against GPU VRAM. *Only tiny models in browsers |
| Embedding (BERT, etc.) | ✅ High | ✅ High | ✅ High | ✅ Medium | ✅ High | ✅ Medium | Efficient on all hardware. Best on WebNN for browsers |
| Vision (ViT, CLIP, etc.) | ✅ High | ✅ Medium | ✅ High | ✅ High | ✅ Medium | ✅ High | OpenVINO for servers, WebGPU for browsers |
| Audio (Whisper, etc.) | ✅ High | ✅ Medium | ✅ Medium | ✅ Medium | ❌ N/A | ❌ N/A | CUDA preferred for performance |
| Multimodal (LLaVA, etc.) | ✅ High | ❌ N/A | ❌ N/A | ❌ N/A | ❌ N/A | ❌ N/A | Typically only fully supported on CUDA |

The ResourcePool's advanced decision system checks each model against this compatibility matrix and makes intelligent decisions about device placement based on:
- Available hardware on the current system
- Model size and memory requirements
- Known hardware compatibility issues
- Optimal performance characteristics
- Model family-specific optimizations
- Web platform deployment needs

You can see this comprehensive system in action by running the enhanced hardware test:

```bash
python generators/models/test_comprehensive_hardware.py --test all
```

This will show detailed hardware-aware model classification results like:

```
Model: bert-base-uncased
  Family: embedding (confidence: 0.75)
  Optimal Hardware: cuda
  PyTorch Device: cuda:0
  Hardware Priority: cuda > mps > cpu
  Recommended Template: hf_embedding_template.py
  Hardware Compatibility:
    cuda: ✅ (System: ✅, Effective: ✅)
    mps: ✅ (System: ❌, Effective: ❌)
    openvino: ✅ (System: ✅, Effective: ✅)
    webnn: ✅ (System: ❌, Effective: ❌)
    webgpu: ✅ (System: ❌, Effective: ❌)
```

### Enhanced Memory Tracking

The ResourcePool uses multiple methods to accurately track memory usage across all system and device resources:

```python
pool = get_global_resource_pool()
stats = pool.get_stats()

# See overall memory usage
print(f"Total memory usage: {stats['memory_usage_mb']:.2f} MB")

# Get system memory status
system_memory = stats.get("system_memory", {})
if system_memory:
    available_mb = system_memory.get("available_mb", 0)
    percent_used = system_memory.get("percent_used", 0)
    print(f"System memory: {available_mb:.2f} MB available, {percent_used}% used")
    
    # Check for memory pressure
    under_pressure = system_memory.get("under_pressure", False)
    if under_pressure:
        print("System is under memory pressure - consider clearing resources")

# Get CUDA memory status
cuda_memory = stats.get("cuda_memory", {})
if cuda_memory and cuda_memory.get("device_count", 0) > 0:
    print("CUDA memory stats:")
    for device in cuda_memory.get("devices", []):
        print(f"  Device {device['id']} ({device['name']}): {device['free_mb']:.2f} MB free, {device['percent_used']:.1f}% used")

# Get detailed per-model memory information
for key in pool.models:
    if key in pool._stats:
        memory_mb = pool._stats[key].get('memory_usage', 0) / (1024 * 1024)
        method = pool._stats[key].get('memory_estimation_method', 'unknown')
        device = pool._stats[key].get('device', 'unknown')
        print(f"Model {key}: {memory_mb:.2f} MB (method: {method}, device: {device})")
```

## Example Test Implementation

Here's an example of a test implementation that uses the ResourcePool with all the advanced features:

        # Short timeout for cleanup in test environment
        pool.cleanup_unused_resources(max_age_minutes=0.1)  # 6 seconds

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```

## Monitoring Resource Usage

The ResourcePool provides comprehensive usage statistics that can be accessed through the `get_stats()` method:

```python
pool = get_global_resource_pool()
stats = pool.get_stats()
print(f"Resource pool stats: {stats}")
```

The comprehensive stats include:
- **Cache Statistics**:
  - Hit count (number of cache hits)
  - Miss count (number of cache misses)
  - Hit ratio (ratio of hits to total requests)
  - Resource counts (total resources, models, tokenizers)

- **Memory Usage**:
  - Total memory usage (in MB)
  - Per-model memory usage with estimation method
  - Per-device memory usage

- **System Resources**:
  - System memory availability and usage
  - Memory pressure detection
  - CPU utilization

- **GPU Resources** (when available):
  - Per-GPU memory allocation
  - Per-GPU utilization
  - Tensor core availability
  - CUDA/ROCm version information
  
- **Other Hardware**:
  - MPS availability and usage (Apple Silicon)
  - OpenVINO device information
  - WebNN/WebGPU compatibility
  
- **Resource Management**:
  - Low memory mode status
  - Cleanup statistics
  - Resource age tracking

## Best Practices

1. **Use Model Family Information**: Always specify the model family when requesting models for optimal hardware selection
2. **Provide Constructors**: Always provide a constructor function when requesting resources
3. **Clean Up Regularly**: Call `cleanup_unused_resources()` periodically to free memory
4. **Share Dependencies**: Use the ResourcePool to share common dependencies like PyTorch and Transformers
5. **Monitor Memory Usage**: Check the resource pool stats to monitor memory usage and system pressure
6. **Hardware-Aware Test Design**: Design tests to leverage the hardware-aware resource allocation system
7. **Use Hardware Preferences**: Provide hardware_preferences to specify device selection for different model types
8. **Leverage Multi-GPU Systems**: Use preferred_index in hardware_preferences to distribute models across multiple GPUs
9. **Define Custom Priority Lists**: Create model-specific hardware priority lists for optimal performance
10. **Integrate Hardware Detection**: Use the hardware_detection module for automatic device selection
11. **Use Model Family Classification**: Leverage model family classification for optimized resource allocation
12. **Enable Low-Memory Mode**: Use low-memory mode on resource-constrained systems or set environment variable RESOURCE_POOL_LOW_MEMORY=1
13. **Consider Model Compatibility**: Be aware of model-specific hardware compatibility issues across platforms
14. **Implement Robust Error Handling**: Use file existence checks and try/except blocks for optional components
15. **Test Integration**: Use test_comprehensive_hardware.py to verify all components work together

17. **Centralize Resource Pool Access**: Always use get_global_resource_pool() to ensure synchronized resource access
18. **Platform-Specific Optimizations**: Consider platform-specific needs in hardware_preferences
19. **Web Platform Support**: Use WebNN/WebGPU compatibility options for web deployment scenarios:
   ```python
   # Example of web platform preferences for browser deployment
   web_preferences = {
       "priority_list": ["webnn", "webgpu", "cpu"],
       "model_family": "embedding",
       "subfamily": "web_deployment",
       "fallback_to_simulation": True
   }
   ```
20. **Memory Pressure Monitoring**: Check for system memory pressure and trigger cleanup when needed

## Limitations

1. **Memory Estimation**: Memory usage estimation is approximate, especially for complex models
2. **Resource Dependencies**: Resources with complex dependencies may not be properly tracked
3. **Non-Python Resources**: The ResourcePool is designed for Python resources and may not work well with non-Python resources
4. **WebNN/WebGPU Limitations**: Web platform integration requires additional setup and has limited hardware access
5. **Deep Module Dependencies**: Resources with complex import hierarchies may need manual dependency management
6. **Mixed Precision Limitations**: Not all models support efficient mixed precision usage
7. **Cross-Backend Optimizations**: Some optimizations are specific to particular hardware backends
8. **Dynamic Graph Models**: Models using dynamic computation graphs may have less accurate memory estimation
9. **Custom CUDA Kernels**: Models with custom CUDA kernels may require special handling
10. **Distributed Training**: ResourcePool focuses on inference cases, distributed training requires additional consideration

## Resilient Error Handling

The ResourcePool system is designed with robust error handling to function gracefully even when optional components are missing:

1. **Modular Dependencies**: Each component checks for the existence of its dependencies before attempting to use them
2. **Graceful Degradation**: When generators/hardware/hardware_detection.py or model_family_classifier.py are missing, the system falls back to basic functionality
3. **Runtime Feature Detection**: Components automatically detect available features at runtime rather than failing during import
4. **Comprehensive Error Logging**: Clear error messages explain what features are missing and how the system is adapting
5. **Self-Testing Capability**: The run_integrated_hardware_model_test.py script verifies all components work together correctly
6. **Dynamic Import System**: Optional components are imported only when needed to minimize potential import errors
7. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Fallback mechanisms ensure functionality across different platforms
8. **Contextual Error Handling**: Error handling strategies are tailored to specific usage contexts
9. **Hardware Fallback Chain**: Well-defined fallback path from specialized hardware to general-purpose hardware
10. **Automatic Memory Recovery**: System can detect and recover from out-of-memory situations
11. **Component Status Monitoring**: Continuous monitoring of component status during operation
12. **WebNN/WebGPU Adaptation**: Special handling for web platform deployment scenarios
13. **File Existence Checks**: System checks for the presence of optional module files before attempting imports
14. **Component-Aware Operation**: ResourcePool adapts its behavior based on available components at runtime
15. **Multi-Level Fallbacks**: Progressive fallback mechanisms with detailed logging at each step
16. **Isolated Component Failures**: Failures in one component do not prevent other components from functioning
17. **Web Platform Error Management**: Robust detection and handling of WebNN and WebGPU errors
18. **Simulation Mode Fallbacks**: Automatic fallback to simulation mode when real web platform implementations are unavailable
19. **Subfamily-Based Error Handling**: Specialized error handling strategies for web deployment subfamilies
20. **Hardware Compatibility Reporting**: Comprehensive error reporting system for hardware compatibility issues
21. **Error Analysis and Recommendations**: Intelligent analysis of errors with context-specific recommendations
22. **Alternative Hardware Suggestions**: Automatic suggestion of alternative hardware when compatibility issues occur
23. **Persistent Error Reports**: Optional saving of structured error reports for offline analysis
24. **Memory-Specific Recommendations**: Special error handling for out-of-memory conditions with tailored suggestions
25. **Operation Compatibility Analysis**: Identification of unsupported operations with platform-specific alternatives
26. **Driver Version Management**: Suggestions for driver updates and version compatibility checks
27. **Model Family-Aware Error Handling**: Integration of model family information into error analysis and recommendations
