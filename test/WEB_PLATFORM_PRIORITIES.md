The implementation is on track for completion by August 2025, with the Streaming Inference Pipeline targeted for completion by mid-April 2025.

The highest priority is completing the Streaming Inference Pipeline, which is 92% complete and crucial for enabling real-time, token-by-token generation with low latency. This will be followed by the Unified Framework Integration (now 67% complete) to provide a cohesive API across all components, and the Performance Dashboard (now 77% complete) to enable comprehensive performance monitoring and optimization.

Recent achievements include:
1. **KV Cache Optimization**: Completed implementation with sliding window attention support and context extension capabilities.
2. **Adaptive Batch Sizing**: Successfully implemented with device capability detection and memory monitoring.
3. **Cross-Component API Standardization**: Completed to ensure consistent interfaces across all modules.

With the current development pace and resource allocation, all components are expected to be completed on schedule, delivering a comprehensive web platform implementation that enables running advanced machine learning models directly in web browsers with unprecedented efficiency and performance. We are currently ahead of schedule on both the Streaming Inference Pipeline and Performance Dashboard components, which puts us in an excellent position to complete the full implementation by the target date.
