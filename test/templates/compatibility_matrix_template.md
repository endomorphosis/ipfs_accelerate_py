# Comprehensive Model Compatibility Matrix

**Generated:** {{ generated_date }} | **Models:** {{ total_models }} | **Hardware Platforms:** {{ total_hardware_platforms }}

## Compatibility Levels
- ‚úÖ Full Support: Fully tested and optimized
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial Support: Works with some limitations
- üî∂ Limited Support: Basic functionality only
- ‚ùå Not Supported: Known incompatibility
