## Implementation Approach

For implementing these tests, we recommend the following approach:

1. **Templated Implementation**: Use existing test files like `test_hf_bert.py` as templates, since they contain comprehensive implementations for multiple hardware backends (CPU, CUDA, OpenVINO).

2. **Incremental Testing**: Focus first on making the CPU version work, then add GPU (CUDA) support, and finally OpenVINO support.

3. **Minimal Dependencies**: Keep test dependencies minimal to ensure tests can run even when optional packages are not installed.

4. **Consistent Structure**: Maintain a consistent structure across all test files:
   - Standard imports section
   - Model-specific configuration and setup
   - Hardware-specific implementation methods
   - Test class with consistent methods
   - Result collection and validation

5. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to provide meaningful error messages and ensure graceful degradation.

## Pipeline Coverage Analysis

The implementation plan will improve pipeline coverage as follows:

| Pipeline Task | Current Coverage | Phase 1 Coverage | Full Plan Coverage |
|---------------|------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| text-generation | 28% | 52% | 95% |
| image-to-text | 12% | 47% | 85% |
| visual-question-answering | 14% | 51% | 88% |
| image-classification | 15% | 35% | 75% |
| image-segmentation | 9% | 45% | 91% |
| automatic-speech-recognition | 10% | 40% | 80% |
| text-to-audio | 0% | 40% | 80% |
| feature-extraction | 32% | 47% | 85% |
| fill-mask | 35% | 35% | 95% |
| question-answering | 40% | 40% | 90% |
| document-question-answering | 10% | 10% | 95% |
| table-question-answering | 0% | 0% | 100% |
| time-series-prediction | 0% | 0% | 100% |

## Implementation Timeline

Based on current development velocity, we recommend the following timeline:

- **Phase 1 (Critical Models)**: Complete in 3-4 weeks
- **Phase 2 (Medium-Priority Models)**: Complete in 4-6 weeks after Phase 1
- **Phase 3 (Lower-Priority Models)**: Complete in 6-8 weeks after Phase 2

## Test Template Generation Script

To facilitate rapid test implementation, we recommend creating a script that can generate test file templates for each model type. Example:

```python
def generate_model_test_template(model_type, pipeline_tasks):
    """Generate a test file template for a specific model type.
    
    Args:
        model_type (str): The HuggingFace model type (e.g., "bert", "gpt2")
        pipeline_tasks (list): List of pipeline tasks this model can perform
    
    Returns:
        str: Generated test file content
    """
    # Load the template file
    with open("templates/model_test_template.py", "r") as f:
        template = f.read()
    
    # Replace placeholder values
    template = template.replace("{{MODEL_TYPE}}", model_type)
    template = template.replace("{{MODEL_CLASS}}", model_type.upper())
    template = template.replace("{{PIPELINE_TASKS}}", ", ".join(pipeline_tasks))
    
    # Add more model-specific customizations as needed
    
    return template
```

This script could be expanded to automatically pull model information from the HuggingFace API and generate appropriate test files based on model capabilities.
