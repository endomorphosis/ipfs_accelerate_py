## Getting Started

### Basic Usage

```python
from fixed_web_platform.resource_pool_integration import create_ipfs_web_accelerator

# Create accelerator with default settings
accelerator = create_ipfs_web_accelerator()

# Load a model with WebGPU acceleration
model = accelerator.accelerate_model(
    model_name="bert-base-uncased",
    platform="webgpu"
)

# Create input data
inputs = {
    "input_ids": [101, 2023, 2003, 1037, 3231, 102],
    "attention_mask": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
}

# Run inference
result = accelerator.run_inference("bert-base-uncased", inputs)

# Get performance metrics
metrics = accelerator.integration.get_metrics()
print(f"Inference time: {metrics['aggregate']['avg_inference_time']:.4f}s")
print(f"Throughput: {metrics['aggregate']['avg_throughput']:.2f} items/s")

# Clean up resources
accelerator.close()
```

2. Ensure the browser is not blocked by firewall settings
3. Try using a different port with `accelerator = create_ipfs_web_accelerator(websocket_port=9876)`
4. Restart any running browser instances
5. **New (March 2025)**: Use enhanced retry with `create_ipfs_web_accelerator(connection_retry_attempts=3)`
6. **New (March 2025)**: Check browser proxy settings that might interfere with WebSocket

### Browser Initialization Errors

**Symptoms**: "Failed to launch browser" or "Error setting up WebSocket server"

**Solutions**:
1. Ensure the correct browser is installed
2. Check browser path with `which chrome` or `which firefox`
3. Try headless mode with `accelerator = create_ipfs_web_accelerator(headless=True)`
4. Close any existing browser instances that might conflict
5. **New (March 2025)**: Verify browser permissions for WebSocket server access
6. **New (March 2025)**: Check for browser extensions that might block WebSocket connections

2. Use longer timeout for large models with `timeout_multiplier=3`
3. Enable progressive backoff with `enable_progressive_backoff=True`
4. Check for browser throttling of background tabs
5. For audio and vision models, use model-specific timeouts:
   ```python
   # Configure longer timeouts for audio models
   integration.configure_model_timeouts({
       'audio': 3.0,       # 3x standard timeout for audio
       'vision': 2.0,      # 2x standard timeout for vision
