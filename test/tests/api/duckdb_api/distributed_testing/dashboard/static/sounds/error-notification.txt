# Error Notification Sound System

This directory contains sound files for the Error Visualization system's notification feature. These files are used to provide auditory feedback for different error severities.

## Sound Files

The system uses the following sound files:

1. **error-system-critical.mp3**: Highest-priority alert sound for system-level critical errors (1.0s duration)
   * Used for coordinator failure, database corruption, and security breaches
   * Rising frequency pattern (880Hz → 1046.5Hz → 1318.5Hz) with increasing urgency
   * Features accelerating pulse rate (4Hz to 16Hz) and harmonic richness
   * Designed for immediate attention in critical system failures

2. **error-critical.mp3**: High-priority alert sound for critical errors (0.7s duration)
   * Used for hardware availability errors, resource allocation errors, and worker crashes
   * Higher frequency (880Hz/440Hz) with attention-grabbing tonal pattern
   * Includes a pulsing effect (8Hz modulation) for urgency

3. **error-warning.mp3**: Medium-priority alert sound for warning-level errors (0.5s duration)
   * Used for network errors, resource cleanup issues, and worker timeouts
   * Medium frequency (660Hz/330Hz) with moderate decay
   * Dual-tone approach for distinctiveness

4. **error-info.mp3**: Low-priority notification sound for informational errors (0.3s duration)
   * Used for test execution errors and other non-critical issues
   * Lower frequency (523Hz) with quick decay
   * Short, subtle tone that's non-intrusive

5. **error-notification.mp3**: Default notification sound (fallback)
   * Copy of error-critical.mp3 by default
   * Used when specific severity sounds fail to load

## Sound Generation

These sound files are automatically generated using the `generate_sound_files.py` script in this directory. The script uses numpy and scipy to synthesize the tones with specific acoustic properties for each severity level.

To regenerate the sound files:

```bash
python generate_sound_files.py
```

## Custom Sounds

You can replace these files with your own custom sounds if desired. Just make sure to keep the same filenames and format (MP3) for compatibility with the dashboard.

## Volume Control

The dashboard provides volume control and mute functionality for these sounds through the UI. These settings are saved in the browser's localStorage for persistence between sessions.

## Technical Details

The sound generation uses the following parameters:

1. System-Critical Sound:
   * Frequencies: Rising pattern 880Hz (A5) → 1046.5Hz (C6) → 1318.5Hz (E6)
   * Accelerating pulse rate from 4Hz to 16Hz
   * Additional harmonic at 1760Hz (A6) for richness
   * Three distinct segments with crossfading
   * Duration: 1.0 seconds

2. Critical Sound:
   * Frequencies: 880Hz (A5) and 440Hz (A4)
   * Amplitude modulation with 8Hz pulsing
   * Duration: 0.7 seconds

3. Warning Sound:
   * Frequencies: 660Hz (E5) and 330Hz (E4)
   * Moderate decay profile
   * Duration: 0.5 seconds

4. Info Sound:
   * Frequency: 523.25Hz (C5)
   * Quick decay profile
   * Duration: 0.3 seconds

All sounds are normalized to prevent clipping and converted to 16-bit PCM before encoding as MP3.
