# Distributed Testing Framework - Examples

This directory contains example scripts that demonstrate the usage of the Distributed Testing Framework and its plugins.

## Available Examples

### Plugin Example

**File**: `plugin_example.py`

This script demonstrates how to use the plugin architecture of the Distributed Testing Framework:

- Creating and initializing a coordinator with plugin support
- Discovering and loading plugins
- Configuring plugins with specific settings
- Handling events through the plugin system
- Creating a custom notification plugin
- Simulating worker registration and task execution

### CI Integration Example

**File**: `ci_integration_example.py`

This script demonstrates how to use the CI integration features of the hardware monitoring system:

- Running tests with CI integration
- Generating status badges
- Sending notifications based on test results
- Configuring notification channels
- Using different test modes
- Customizing output paths and database locations

### GitHub PR Comment Example

**File**: `github_pr_comment_example.md`

This file provides an example of a GitHub pull request comment generated by the CI notification system:

- Test summary with status, workflow, and commit information
- Detailed test results with counts and durations
- Failed test information with error messages and locations
- Resource utilization metrics
- Next steps and helpful links
- Status badge integration

### Running the Examples

```bash
# Make sure you're in the distributed_testing directory
cd /path/to/distributed_testing

# Run the plugin example
python examples/plugin_example.py

# Run the CI integration example
python examples/ci_integration_example.py

# Run CI integration with specific options
python examples/ci_integration_example.py --generate-badge --notification

# Run full CI simulation
python examples/ci_integration_example.py --test-mode full --generate-badge --notification --ci-integration
```

## Creating Your Own Examples

Feel free to create additional examples in this directory to demonstrate specific aspects of the framework. When creating examples:

1. Use clear, descriptive file names
2. Include comprehensive docstrings explaining the purpose
3. Add comments to explain key sections of code
4. Handle errors gracefully
5. Include logging for better understanding
