# IPFS Accelerate Python Framework - Development Guide

> **ORGANIZATION UPDATE (March 10, 2025):**
>
> The codebase has been reorganized for better maintainability with the following top-level structure:
> 
> - All generator files moved to the top-level `generators/` directory (216 files) with subdirectories:
>   - `generators/benchmark_generators/`: Benchmark generation tools
>   - `generators/models/`: Model implementations and skills
>   - `generators/runners/`: Test runner scripts
>   - `generators/skill_generators/`: Skill generation tools
>   - `generators/template_generators/`: Template generation utilities
>   - `generators/templates/`: Template files for model generation
>   - `generators/test_generators/`: Test generation tools
>   - `generators/utils/`: Utility functions
>   - `generators/hardware/`: Hardware-specific generator tools
>
> - All database-related tools moved to the top-level `duckdb_api/` directory (83 files) with subdirectories:
>   - `duckdb_api/core/`: Core database functionality
>   - `duckdb_api/migration/`: Migration tools for JSON to database
>   - `duckdb_api/schema/`: Database schema definitions 
>   - `duckdb_api/utils/`: Utility functions for database operations
>   - `duckdb_api/visualization/`: Result visualization tools
>   - `duckdb_api/distributed_testing/`: Distributed testing framework components
>
> - Web platform implementations remain in `fixed_web_platform/` directory with subdirectories:
>   - `fixed_web_platform/unified_framework/`: Unified API for cross-browser WebNN/WebGPU
>   - `fixed_web_platform/wgsl_shaders/`: WebGPU Shading Language shader implementations
>
> - CI/CD workflow files moved from `test/.github/workflows/` to the standard `.github/workflows/` location
>
> **WEBGPU/WEBNN JAVASCRIPT SDK MIGRATION (MARCH 2025):**
>
> We have successfully migrated all WebGPU/WebNN implementations from `/fixed_web_platform/` to a dedicated `ipfs_accelerate_js` folder. This migration creates a clearer separation between JavaScript-based components and Python-based components and enables independent SDK development and deployment.
>
> The new JavaScript SDK structure follows a standardized NPM package layout with TypeScript declarations:

## Key Features and Components

### Cross-Model Tensor Sharing

The Cross-Model Tensor Sharing system enables efficient sharing of tensors between multiple models, 
significantly improving memory efficiency and performance for multi-model workloads:

- **Shared Tensor Memory**: Multiple models can share the same tensor memory for common components
- **Reference Counting**: Intelligent memory management ensures tensors are only freed when no longer needed
- **Zero-Copy Tensor Views**: Create views into tensors without duplicating memory
- **Browser Storage Types**: Support for different tensor storage formats (CPU, WebGPU, WebNN)
- **Automatic Memory Optimization**: Identifies and frees unused tensors to reduce memory footprint
- **Intelligent Sharing Patterns**: Automatically identifies which models can share tensors

### Performance Benefits

- **Memory Reduction**: Up to 30% memory reduction for common multi-model workflows
- **Inference Speedup**: Up to 30% faster inference when reusing cached embeddings
- **Increased Throughput**: Higher throughput when running multiple related models
- **Browser Resource Efficiency**: More efficient use of limited browser memory resources

### Tensor Sharing Types

The system automatically identifies compatible model combinations for sharing:

| Tensor Type | Compatible Models | Description |
|-------------|------------------|-------------|
| text_embedding | BERT, T5, LLAMA, BART | Text embeddings for NLP models |
| vision_embedding | ViT, CLIP, DETR | Vision embeddings for image models |
| audio_embedding | Whisper, Wav2Vec2, CLAP | Audio embeddings for speech/audio models |
| vision_text_joint | CLIP, LLaVA, BLIP | Joint embeddings for multimodal models |
| audio_text_joint | CLAP, Whisper-Text | Joint embeddings for audio-text models |

### WebNN and WebGPU Benchmarking Tools

The framework includes comprehensive tools for benchmarking real WebNN and WebGPU implementations in browsers with clear distinction between real hardware acceleration and simulation mode:

```bash
# Run WebGPU benchmarks with Chrome
python benchmark_real_webnn_webgpu.py --webgpu --chrome

# Run WebNN benchmarks with Edge (best WebNN support)
python benchmark_real_webnn_webgpu.py --webnn --edge

# Run audio model benchmarks with Firefox (best for compute shaders)
python benchmark_real_webnn_webgpu.py --audio --firefox

# Benchmark with quantization (8-bit)
python benchmark_real_webnn_webgpu.py --text --bits 8

# Benchmark with mixed precision (4-bit)
python benchmark_real_webnn_webgpu.py --text --bits 4 --mixed-precision

# Run comprehensive benchmarks across multiple models
python benchmark_real_webnn_webgpu.py --comprehensive

# Store results in database

python check_browser_webnn_webgpu.py --browser firefox

# Fix WebNN/WebGPU benchmarking issues
python fix_real_webnn_webgpu_benchmarks.py --browser chrome --fix-all
```

### Browser-Specific Optimizations

Different browsers excel at different tasks:

| Browser | Best For | Features | Command Flag |
|---------|----------|----------|-------------|
| Firefox | Audio models | 20-25% better performance for Whisper, CLAP | `--browser firefox --optimize-audio` |
| Edge | WebNN models | Superior WebNN implementation | `--browser edge --platform webnn` |

## Web Resource Pool Integration

The WebGPU/WebNN Resource Pool Integration enables concurrent execution of multiple AI models across heterogeneous browser backends. It dramatically improves throughput, reduces resource waste, and provides fine-grained control over browser-based hardware acceleration resources. The system is now being enhanced with fault tolerance features based on the recently completed distributed testing framework implementation.

### Key Features

- **Concurrent Model Execution**: Run multiple models simultaneously (3.5x throughput improvement)
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficiently manage browser connections with lifecycle management
- **Browser-Aware Load Balancing**: Distribute models to optimal browsers based on model type
- **Adaptive Resource Scaling**: Dynamically adjust resource allocation based on demand
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Track resource utilization and performance metrics
- **Fault-Tolerant Model Sharding**: Distribute model execution across multiple browsers with failover capabilities
- **Cross-Browser Recovery**: Automatically recover from browser crashes or disconnections
- **Transaction-Based State Management**: Ensure consistent state across browser instances
- **Performance History Analysis**: Track and analyze performance trends to optimize resource allocation

### Using the Resource Pool with Fault Tolerance

```python
# Create resource pool integration with fault tolerance
from fixed_web_platform.resource_pool_bridge import ResourcePoolBridgeIntegration

integration = ResourcePoolBridgeIntegration(
    max_connections=4,
    browser_preferences={
        'audio': 'firefox',     # Firefox for audio models
        'vision': 'chrome',     # Chrome for vision models
        'text_embedding': 'edge' # Edge for embedding models
    },
    adaptive_scaling=True,
    enable_fault_tolerance=True,  # Enable fault tolerance features
    recovery_strategy='progressive',  # Use progressive recovery strategy
    state_sync_interval=5,  # Sync state every 5 seconds
    redundancy_factor=2  # Keep redundant copies for critical operations
)

# Initialize the integration
integration.initialize()

# Get model from resource pool with fault tolerance
model = integration.get_model(
    model_type='text_embedding',
    model_name='bert-base-uncased',
    hardware_preferences={'priority_list': ['webgpu', 'cpu']},
    fault_tolerance={
        'recovery_timeout': 30,  # Maximum recovery time in seconds
        'state_persistence': True,  # Persist state between sessions
        'failover_strategy': 'immediate'  # Immediate failover on error
    }
)

# Run inference with automatic recovery
try:
    result = model(inputs)
except BrowserError as e:
    # Automatic recovery will be attempted based on configured strategy
    # If successful, the operation will continue
    print(f"Recovered from: {e}")
```

### Cross-Browser Model Sharding

The new fault-tolerant cross-browser model sharding feature allows running large models by distributing them across multiple browser instances:

```python
# Set up sharded model execution
from fixed_web_platform.model_sharding import ShardedModelExecution

sharded_execution = ShardedModelExecution(
    model_name="llama-13b",
    sharding_strategy="layer_balanced",  # Distribute model by layers
    num_shards=3,  # Split across 3 browser instances
    fault_tolerance_level="high",  # High level of fault tolerance
    recovery_strategy="coordinated",  # Synchronized recovery
    connection_pool=integration.connection_pool  # Use existing pool
)

# Initialize sharded execution
sharded_execution.initialize()

# Run inference on sharded model with automatic recovery
result = sharded_execution.run_inference(inputs)
```

### Performance History and Analysis

The performance history tracking feature allows optimization based on historical data:

```python
# Access performance history
history = integration.get_performance_history(
    model_type="text_embedding",
    time_range="7d",  # Last 7 days
    metrics=["latency", "throughput", "browser_utilization"]
)

# Analyze trends and get recommendations
recommendations = integration.analyze_performance_trends(history)

# Apply recommendations automatically
integration.apply_performance_optimizations(recommendations)
```
