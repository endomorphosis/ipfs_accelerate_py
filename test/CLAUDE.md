## High Availability Clustering

The High Availability Clustering feature provides coordinator redundancy through a Raft-inspired consensus algorithm, enabling automatic failover and improved fault tolerance for the Distributed Testing Framework.

### Architecture Highlights

- **Raft-Inspired Consensus**: Modified algorithm for leader election among coordinator nodes
- **State Machine Architecture**: Coordinator states (leader, follower, candidate, offline) with transition rules
- **Health Monitoring**: Real-time tracking of CPU, memory, disk, and network metrics
- **Self-Healing**: Automatic recovery from resource constraints
- **WebNN/WebGPU Detection**: Browser and hardware capability awareness
- **Visualization Tools**: Both graphical and text-based state visualization
