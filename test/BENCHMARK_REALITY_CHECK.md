# Benchmark Reality Check and Action Plan

**Date:** March 6, 2025  
**Status:** IMPLEMENTATION IN PROGRESS  
**Team:** Hardware Benchmarking Team

## Current Situation

Our current benchmark reports and timing data appear to be using **simulated benchmarks** rather than actual hardware measurements. While the report infrastructure is excellent and provides insightful visualizations and analyses, the underlying data does not reflect real-world hardware performance, particularly for platforms we don't have direct access to (QNN, ROCm, MPS, WebNN, WebGPU).

## Evidence of Simulation

1. The `benchmark_timing_report.py` file contains a fallback mechanism that generates sample data when it fails to retrieve actual benchmark results from the database:
   ```python
   try:
       result = self.conn.execute(query).fetchdf()
       if len(result) > 0:
           return result
   except Exception as e:
       logger.warning(f"Failed to fetch real data: {str(e)}. Using sample data instead.")
   
   # Generate sample data if we couldn't get real data
   logger.info("Using sample data for the report")
   ```

2. The script contains hardcoded benchmark values for all hardware platforms:
   ```python
   # Predefined performance characteristics to make the data realistic
   model_characteristics = {
       "bert": {"latency": {"cpu": 25.5, "cuda": 8.2, "rocm": 9.4, "mps": 15.6, 
                "openvino": 12.8, "qnn": 18.3, "webnn": 19.7, "webgpu": 14.5},
   ```

3. The warning message in our earlier run confirms the use of simulated data:
   ```
   Failed to fetch real data: Binder Error: Referenced table "pr2" not found!
   Using sample data for the report
   ```

## Impact

While the simulation provides a visually impressive report and can be used for design purposes, it does not:

1. Reflect actual hardware performance
2. Help with legitimate hardware selection decisions
3. Identify real-world performance bottlenecks
4. Allow for accurate comparison between hardware platforms

## Action Taken

We've implemented fixes to address these critical benchmark system issues:

1. **Database Schema Updates**
   - Added `is_simulated` and `simulation_reason` flags to performance_results table
   - Created `hardware_availability_log` table to track actual hardware availability
   - Tagged all existing benchmark data as simulated for transparency

2. **Hardware Detection Improvements**
   - Fixed hardware detection to use reliable methods for actually available hardware
   - Removed environment variable overrides that artificially flagged hardware as available
   - Added verification steps to confirm hardware detection is working properly

3. **Benchmark Runners**
   - Created `run_direct_benchmark.py` for direct model benchmarking with database storage
   - Created `run_batch_benchmarks.py` for running benchmarks on multiple models in parallel
   - Implemented proper error handling with categorization
   - Added proper simulation status tracking
   - Implemented verification steps to confirm fixes work properly

4. **Database-First Storage Strategy**
   - Updated all benchmarking tools to store results in DuckDB by default
   - Deprecated JSON file output in favor of database storage (controlled by `DEPRECATE_JSON_OUTPUT=1`)
   - Created proper database schema for storing benchmark results
   - Added tracking of simulation status in the database

5. **Hardware Availability Report**
   - Created `hardware_reality_check.py` to detect actual hardware availability
   - Logged hardware availability to the database
   - Generated detailed hardware availability report

## Current Hardware Availability

Our hardware detection shows the following hardware is actually available:

| Hardware | Status | Details |
|----------|--------|---------|
| CPU | ‚úÖ AVAILABLE | Intel Xeon E3-1535M v6 @ 3.10GHz, 8 cores |
| CUDA | ‚úÖ AVAILABLE | NVIDIA Quadro P4000, 8GB VRAM, CUDA 12.4 |
| ROCm | ‚ùå NOT AVAILABLE | AMD GPU hardware not present |
| MPS | ‚ùå NOT AVAILABLE | Not running on Apple Silicon |
| OpenVINO | ‚úÖ AVAILABLE | Version 2025.0.0, CPU execution only |
| QNN | ‚ùå NOT AVAILABLE | Qualcomm AI SDK not installed |
| WebNN | ‚ùå NOT AVAILABLE | Requires browser environment |
| WebGPU | ‚ùå NOT AVAILABLE | Requires browser environment |

## Running Actual Benchmarks

We've created new scripts to run real hardware benchmarks on actually available hardware:

### Direct Benchmark for a Single Model

```bash
# Run benchmark with database storage (recommended)
python run_direct_benchmark.py --model bert-base-uncased --hardware cpu --batch-sizes 1,2,4

# Run benchmark with database-only storage (no JSON files)
python run_direct_benchmark.py --model bert-base-uncased --hardware cpu --db-only

# Run benchmark with JSON-only storage (not recommended)
python run_direct_benchmark.py --model bert-base-uncased --hardware cpu --no-db

# Specify custom database path
python run_direct_benchmark.py --model bert-base-uncased --hardware cpu --db-path ./custom_benchmark.duckdb
```

### Batch Benchmarks for Multiple Models

```bash
# Run benchmarks for multiple models with database storage
python run_batch_benchmarks.py --models "bert-base-uncased prajjwal1/bert-tiny" --hardware cpu

# Run benchmarks for all default models
python run_batch_benchmarks.py --all-default-models --hardware cpu --db-only

# Run benchmarks with parallel processing (3 models at a time)
python run_batch_benchmarks.py --all-default-models --hardware cpu --max-workers 3
```

These scripts run benchmarks and properly mark the results as real (not simulated) in the database. You can verify the results by querying the database:

```sql
-- Check simulation status of benchmark results
SELECT model_name, hardware_type, is_simulated, simulation_reason
FROM performance_results pr
JOIN models m ON pr.model_id = m.model_id
JOIN hardware_platforms hp ON pr.hardware_id = hp.hardware_id
ORDER BY pr.created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

   - Generate comprehensive reports based on actual data
   - Publish final benchmark results and hardware selection guidance

## Clear Delineation of Real vs. Simulated Data

To ensure transparent handling of benchmark data, we've implemented several safeguards:

1. **Database Schema**
   - Added `is_simulated` flag to mark whether data is from real hardware or simulated
   - Added `simulation_reason` to indicate why the data is simulated
   - Created `hardware_availability_log` to track which hardware is actually available
   - Added database constraints to ensure proper relationship tracking

2. **Database-First Storage Strategy**
   - All benchmark results are now stored in DuckDB by default
   - Deprecated JSON file output in favor of database storage
   - Environment variable `DEPRECATE_JSON_OUTPUT=1` enables database-only mode (default)
   - Added `--db-only` flag to benchmark commands to enforce database-only storage
   - Backward compatibility with JSON files still available with `--no-db` flag

3. **UI/Reporting**
   - Added warnings when viewing simulated results
   - Created separate views for verified real hardware results
   - Added confidence ratings for hardware recommendations based on data source
   - Marked simulated data clearly in all visualization outputs

4. **Benchmarking Tools**
   - Added explicit simulation warnings in logs
   - Implemented proper error handling for unavailable hardware
   - Added verification steps to confirm fixes work properly
   - Prevented automatic simulation fallback without explicit user request

## Conclusion

We've made significant progress in addressing the critical benchmark system issues and transitioning from simulated to actual hardware measurements. By implementing proper hardware detection, database schema updates, and creating tools to run benchmarks on actually available hardware, we've laid the foundation for a reliable benchmark system that accurately reflects real-world performance.

The next step is to run comprehensive benchmarks on the hardware platforms that are actually available (CPU, CUDA, OpenVINO) and continue working on accessing or acquiring the remaining platforms. This will ensure our performance recommendations and hardware selection guidance are based on real-world measurements.
