# Browser Environment Validation Guide

This guide explains how to use the browser environment validation system to detect and validate WebNN and WebGPU capabilities across different browsers in the IPFS Accelerate project.

## Overview

The browser environment validation system automatically detects and tests WebNN and WebGPU capabilities across Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari. It can determine whether real hardware acceleration is available or if browsers are using simulation mode. The system also validates the enhanced features from the March 2025 release (compute shaders, shader precompilation, and parallel model loading).

## Why Browser Environment Validation Matters

Browser environment validation is crucial for several reasons:

1. **Performance Optimization**: Different browsers have varying levels of WebNN and WebGPU support. Knowing which browsers provide real hardware acceleration allows you to optimize performance.

2. **Compatibility Assurance**: Before deploying web-based AI models, you need to know which browsers can run them efficiently with hardware acceleration.

3. **Model-Specific Recommendations**: Different model types (text, vision, audio) perform best on different browser-platform combinations.

4. **Enhanced Feature Validation**: The March 2025 features (compute shaders, shader precompilation, parallel loading) need validation across browsers to ensure they deliver the promised performance gains.

5. **Simulation vs. Real Hardware**: Distinguishing between simulation mode and real hardware acceleration is essential for accurate performance expectations.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generate HTML, Markdown, JSON, and CSV reports with detailed test results
- **Browser-Specific Optimizations**: Test specialized optimizations like Firefox's compute shader performance for audio models

## Command-line Usage

### Basic Commands

The simplest way to check browser capabilities is using the `check_browser_webnn_webgpu.py` script:

```bash
# Check all browsers for WebNN and WebGPU support
python check_browser_webnn_webgpu.py --check-all

# Check a specific browser for WebNN and WebGPU support
python check_browser_webnn_webgpu.py --browser chrome

# Check a specific browser for a specific platform
python check_browser_webnn_webgpu.py --browser firefox --platform webgpu

# Check if Edge supports WebNN with hardware acceleration
python check_browser_webnn_webgpu.py --browser edge --platform webnn
```

### Enhanced Feature Testing

To test the March 2025 features, you can use environment variables:

```bash
# Test with compute shader optimization (especially useful for audio models in Firefox)
WEBGPU_COMPUTE_SHADERS_ENABLED=1 python check_browser_webnn_webgpu.py --browser firefox --platform webgpu

# Test with shader precompilation (for faster startup)
WEBGPU_SHADER_PRECOMPILE_ENABLED=1 python check_browser_webnn_webgpu.py --browser chrome --platform webgpu

# Test with parallel model loading (for multimodal models)
WEB_PARALLEL_LOADING_ENABLED=1 python check_browser_webnn_webgpu.py --browser chrome --platform webgpu

# Enable all optimizations
WEBGPU_COMPUTE_SHADERS_ENABLED=1 WEBGPU_SHADER_PRECOMPILE_ENABLED=1 WEB_PARALLEL_LOADING_ENABLED=1 python check_browser_webnn_webgpu.py --browser chrome --platform webgpu
```

### Running in CI/CD

The browser environment validation system includes a GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing. You can run it manually or on push/PR events:

1. Navigate to your repository on GitHub
2. Go to the "Actions" tab
3. Select the "Browser Environment Validation" workflow
4. Click "Run workflow"
5. Select options as needed:
   - **Browser**: chrome, firefox, edge, or all
   - **Platform**: webnn, webgpu, or all
   - **Feature Flags**: comma-separated list of features (compute_shaders, shader_precompile, parallel_loading)

The workflow will:
1. Detect and run tests on selected browsers
2. Generate a detailed validation report
3. Create an interactive dashboard (for push events to main)
4. Display a summary in the workflow run logs

## Programmatic Usage

### Basic WebNN/WebGPU Detection

```python
import asyncio
from check_browser_webnn_webgpu import check_browser_capabilities

async def test_browser():
    # Check if Chrome supports WebGPU
    capabilities = await check_browser_capabilities(
        browser="chrome",
        platform="webgpu",
        headless=True
    )
    
    # Print results
    print(f"WebGPU supported: {capabilities.get('webgpu', {}).get('supported', False)}")
    print(f"Real hardware: {capabilities.get('webgpu', {}).get('real', False)}")
    
    # Get device details
    details = capabilities.get('webgpu', {}).get('details', {})
    if details:
        print(f"Vendor: {details.get('vendor')}")
        print(f"Device: {details.get('device')}")
        print(f"Architecture: {details.get('architecture')}")

# Run the test
asyncio.run(test_browser())
```

### Using the BrowserAutomation Class

For more advanced scenarios, you can use the `BrowserAutomation` class directly:

```python
import asyncio
from fixed_web_platform.browser_automation import BrowserAutomation

async def run_browser_test():
    # Create automation instance
    automation = BrowserAutomation(
        platform="webgpu",
        browser_name="firefox",
        headless=False,
        compute_shaders=True,  # Enable compute shader optimization
        precompile_shaders=True,  # Enable shader precompilation
        parallel_loading=False,  # Disable parallel loading
        model_type="audio"  # Testing for audio models
    )
    
    try:
        # Launch browser
        success = await automation.launch(allow_simulation=True)
        if not success:
            print("Failed to launch browser")
            return
        
        # Check if using real hardware or simulation
        is_simulation = getattr(automation, 'simulation_mode', True)
        print(f"Using simulation mode: {is_simulation}")
        
        # Run a test
        result = await automation.run_test("whisper-tiny", "Test input")
        print(f"Test result: {result}")
        
    finally:
        # Close browser
        await automation.close()

# Run the test
asyncio.run(run_browser_test())
```

## Selenium Integration

The system integrates with Selenium WebDriver for automated browser testing with hardware acceleration detection and recovery capabilities. This integration includes:

1. **Selenium Browser Bridge**: A bridge between Python and Selenium WebDriver with recovery capabilities
2. **Model-Aware Browser Configuration**: Automatically configures browsers for different model types
3. **Recovery Strategies**: Sophisticated recovery strategies for different failure scenarios
4. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Fault tolerance with circuit breaker protection
5. **Comprehensive Test Suite**: Systematic testing of browser and model combinations

### Running the Comprehensive Selenium Test Suite

```bash
# Run a quick test with Chrome only
./distributed_testing/run_selenium_integration_tests.sh --quick

# Run the full test suite with all browsers and models
./distributed_testing/run_selenium_integration_tests.sh --full

# Test Firefox with audio models (optimal for audio processing)
./distributed_testing/run_selenium_integration_tests.sh --firefox-only --audio-only

# Test Edge with text models and WebNN platform (optimal for text models)
./distributed_testing/run_selenium_integration_tests.sh --edge-only --text-only --webnn-only

# Run tests without failure injection
./distributed_testing/run_selenium_integration_tests.sh --no-failures

# Run in simulation mode and save test report
./distributed_testing/run_selenium_integration_tests.sh --simulate --save-report
```

For more information, see the [Selenium Integration README](distributed_testing/SELENIUM_INTEGRATION_README.md).

## Hardware Acceleration Detection

The system detects hardware acceleration by:

1. Checking if WebNN/WebGPU APIs are available in the browser
2. For WebGPU, examining the adapter vendor and device information to distinguish between real hardware and simulation
3. For WebNN, checking if the context type is not "CPU" (which indicates simulation)

### Detection Results

The validation system will categorize a browser into one of three states:

- **HARDWARE**: Real hardware acceleration is available (✅)
- **SIMULATION**: The browser supports the API but is using software simulation (⚠️)
- **NOT SUPPORTED**: The browser doesn't support the API (❌)

## Browser-Specific Recommendations

Based on testing and the implementation in the IPFS Accelerate project, we recommend:

### For TEXT Models (BERT, T5, etc.)
- **First Choice**: Edge with WebNN - Best WebNN implementation
- **Second Choice**: Chrome with WebNN or WebGPU
- **Third Choice**: Any browser with WebGPU support

### For VISION Models (ViT, CLIP, etc.)
- **First Choice**: Chrome with WebGPU - Best general WebGPU support
- **Second Choice**: Edge with WebGPU - Good performance for vision models
- **Third Choice**: Firefox with WebGPU - Acceptable for vision models

### For AUDIO Models (Whisper, Wav2Vec2, CLAP)
- **First Choice**: Firefox with WebGPU - Best compute shader support (20-25% faster for audio models)
- **Second Choice**: Chrome with WebGPU - Good general performance
- **Third Choice**: Edge with WebGPU - Acceptable for audio models
