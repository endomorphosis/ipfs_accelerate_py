   - Secure connection to the monitoring dashboard server
   - Token-based authentication with automatic renewal
   - Robust error handling and reconnection logic

2. **Dashboard Panel Creation**
   - Creation of various visualization panel types
   - Support for different metrics and data filters
   - Configurable panel dimensions and positions

3. **Comprehensive Dashboard Creation**
   - Creation of multi-panel dashboards
   - Support for various visualization types
   - Layout optimization for different panel combinations

4. **Real-Time Monitoring**
   - Real-time updates of simulation metrics
   - Configurable refresh intervals
   - Alert thresholds for drift detection

5. **Integration with Existing Visualization Methods**
   - Updated all visualization methods to support dashboard integration
   - Added dashboard panel creation option to each method
   - Maintained backward compatibility with local file generation

6. **Testing and Documentation**
   - Comprehensive test suite for dashboard integration
   - Detailed documentation of the implementation
   - Usage examples for all new functionality

## Implementation Details

4. **create_comprehensive_monitoring_dashboard()**: Creates a multi-panel dashboard
5. **set_up_real_time_monitoring()**: Sets up real-time monitoring with alerting

### Integration with Existing Methods

Enhanced the following visualization methods to support dashboard integration:

1. **create_mape_comparison_chart_from_db()**: Added `create_dashboard_panel` option
2. **create_hardware_comparison_heatmap_from_db()**: Added `create_dashboard_panel` option
3. **create_time_series_chart_from_db()**: Added `create_dashboard_panel` option

5. **create_calibration_improvement_chart_from_db()**: Added `create_dashboard_panel` option
6. **create_comprehensive_dashboard_from_db()**: Added `create_dashboard` option

## Testing

Implemented a comprehensive test suite in `test_dashboard_integration.py` covering:

1. Dashboard connection and authentication
2. Dashboard panel creation
3. Comprehensive dashboard creation
4. Real-time monitoring setup
5. Integration with visualization methods

The test suite uses mock responses to simulate the dashboard server, allowing for thorough testing without requiring an actual server.

## Documentation

1. **DASHBOARD_INTEGRATION_README.md**: Detailed implementation documentation
2. **MONITORING_DASHBOARD_INTEGRATION.md**: High-level usage guide
3. In-code documentation: Comprehensive docstrings for all methods

## Remaining Tasks Status

We've updated the REMAINING_TASKS.md file to mark the Dashboard Integration task as completed. The remaining tasks include:

1. **Visualization Enhancements** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
2. **Database Performance Optimization** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
3. **Additional Analysis Methods** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
4. **User Interface** (LOW PRIORITY)
5. **Integration Capabilities** (LOW PRIORITY)

## Conclusion

The dashboard integration implementation has successfully fulfilled the requirements of the third major task in the REMAINING_TASKS.md document. The implementation provides a robust, secure, and flexible way to integrate the Simulation Accuracy and Validation Framework with a monitoring dashboard system, enabling real-time visualization and monitoring of simulation validation results.
