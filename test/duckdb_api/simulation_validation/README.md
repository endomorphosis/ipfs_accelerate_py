# Simulation Accuracy and Validation Framework

This directory contains the implementation of the Simulation Accuracy and Validation Framework, which provides comprehensive tools for validating, calibrating, and monitoring hardware simulation accuracy.

## Directory Structure

- `/core`: Core components and interfaces for the framework
- `/comparison`: Tools for comparing simulation results with real hardware measurements
- `/statistical`: Statistical validation tools and metrics
- `/calibration`: Simulation calibration system
- `/drift_detection`: Components for detecting simulation accuracy drift
- `/visualization`: Visualization and reporting tools

## Getting Started

For detailed information on the design and implementation, please refer to the [SIMULATION_ACCURACY_VALIDATION_DESIGN.md](/SIMULATION_ACCURACY_VALIDATION_DESIGN.md) document.

To start using this framework, [detailed documentation will be provided here once implementation begins].

## Dependencies

This framework depends on the following components:
- DuckDB API for data storage and retrieval
- Distributed Testing Framework for real hardware testing
- Monitoring Dashboard for visualization
- Predictive Performance System for uncertainty quantification

## Status

This framework is currently in the design phase. Implementation is planned to begin in July 2025.
