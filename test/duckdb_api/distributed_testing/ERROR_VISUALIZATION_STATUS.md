   - ✅ Interactive charts for error distribution and patterns
   - ✅ Worker error analysis with status tracking
   - ✅ Hardware error analysis with context information
   - ✅ Time range selection (1 hour, 6 hours, 24 hours, 7 days)

3. **Real-Time Error Monitoring**
   - ✅ WebSocket-based real-time error notifications
   - ✅ Error injection test script for generating test errors
   - ✅ Error severity classification algorithm
   - ✅ Visual highlighting based on severity
   - ✅ WebSocket reconnection support

4. **Error Reporting API**
   - ✅ REST API endpoint for reporting errors
   - ✅ Error data storage in DuckDB database
   - ✅ Error categorization and classification
   - ✅ Context collection and analysis

5. **Integration with Monitoring Dashboard**
   - ✅ Dashboard component for error visualization
   - ✅ WebSocket subscription for real-time updates
   - ✅ Theme support (light and dark)
   - ✅ Auto-refresh functionality

## Testing Results

The Error Visualization system has been extensively tested with a comprehensive test suite covering all aspects of the system:

1. **Sound Generation Testing**
   - ✅ All sound files are successfully generated (critical, warning, info, notification)
   - ✅ The sound files are properly named and organized
   - ✅ WAV to MP3 conversion works properly with ffmpeg
   - ✅ Fallback mechanism works when ffmpeg is not available
   - ✅ Sound file characteristics match the intended design criteria

2. **Error Severity Detection Testing**
   - ✅ Critical errors are properly identified based on error categories
   - ✅ Critical errors are properly identified based on hardware status
   - ✅ Critical errors are properly identified based on system metrics
   - ✅ Combined severity factors are properly evaluated
   - ✅ JavaScript severity detection logic matches Python implementation

3. **Error Reporting API Testing**
   - ✅ The API correctly receives and processes error reports
   - ✅ Different error categories are properly handled
   - ✅ Error severity classification works as expected
   - ✅ Context information is properly collected
   - ✅ Error data is correctly stored in the database

4. **Real-Time Error Monitoring Testing**
   - ✅ WebSocket connections are established correctly
   - ✅ Error updates are broadcast in real-time
   - ✅ Multiple error severities are correctly identified
   - ✅ Error highlighting works based on severity
   - ✅ Error frequency tracking works correctly

5. **HTML Template Testing**
   - ✅ Sound notification code is properly implemented
   - ✅ Error severity detection code is properly implemented
   - ✅ WebSocket integration code is properly implemented
   - ✅ Accessibility features are properly implemented

6. **Dashboard Integration Testing**
   - ✅ Error visualization is properly initialized
   - ✅ Dashboard routes handle error visualization requests correctly
   - ✅ WebSocket handler manages error visualization subscriptions
   - ✅ Error reporting integration works correctly
   - ✅ Error data retrieval integration works correctly

7. **Comprehensive Testing Script**
   - ✅ A unified test runner that can execute all error visualization tests
   - ✅ Support for running specific test categories
   - ✅ Support for generating test reports in HTML or XML format

## Future Improvements

While the current implementation is fully functional, there are several potential improvements that could be made:

1. **Enhanced Sound Customization**
   - Allow custom sound files to be uploaded
   - Provide a UI for adjusting sound parameters
   - Support different sound profiles for different users

2. **Advanced Error Analytics**
   - Implement machine learning-based pattern detection
   - Add predictive error analysis to anticipate failures
   - Include historical trend analysis with statistical testing

3. **External Notification Integration**
   - Add Slack/MS Teams integration for team notifications
   - Implement email alerts for critical errors
   - Add mobile push notifications for on-the-go monitoring

4. **User-Specific Preferences**
   - Add user profiles with personalized settings
   - Implement role-based access control for dashboard features
   - Support user-specific notification preferences

5. **Enhanced Visualization**
   - Add more interactive visualizations and charts
   - Implement network graph for error relationships
   - Add timeline view for error sequence analysis

## Conclusion

The Error Visualization system is now fully functional and provides comprehensive error monitoring, analysis, and visualization capabilities for the Distributed Testing Framework. The sound notification system successfully generates different sounds for different error severities, and the system correctly identifies and processes errors of varying severity levels.

The system has been extensively tested and is ready for integration with the broader Distributed Testing Framework.
