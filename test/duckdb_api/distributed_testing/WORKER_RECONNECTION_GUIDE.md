- Implements reconnection logic with exponential backoff
- Tracks task state and results during disconnection
- Provides checkpoint creation and recovery mechanisms
- Monitors connection quality and health

### 2. Connection States and Statistics

The system defines a comprehensive model for connection state tracking:

**Connection States**:
- CONNECTED: Successfully connected and authenticated
- CONNECTING: Actively trying to connect
- DISCONNECTED: Not connected, but attempting reconnection
- FAILED: Connection failed, manual intervention required
- SHUTDOWN: Gracefully shut down

**Connection Statistics**:
- Connected/disconnected time tracking
- Connection attempts and success rates
- Latency measurement and analysis
- Connection stability metrics

### 3. Message Handling System

A robust message handling system ensures reliable communication:

- Message prioritization for critical communications
- Batch processing for efficient state synchronization
- Error handling and recovery for message failures

### 4. Task State Management

Comprehensive task state tracking throughout connection disruptions:

- Current task tracking with execution state
- Task result caching for resubmission after reconnection
- Checkpoint creation and management
- Progressive task state updates

### 5. WorkerReconnectionPlugin

A plugin interface for easy integration into existing worker implementations:

- Non-invasive integration through composition
- Consistent API for reconnection capabilities
- Automatic configuration based on worker settings
- Transparent execution wrapping for task resilience

## Integration with Hardware-Aware Fault Tolerance

The Worker Reconnection System complements the Hardware-Aware Fault Tolerance System by addressing network-related failures while the latter handles hardware-specific failures. Together, they provide a comprehensive fault tolerance solution for the Distributed Testing Framework.

### Complementary Areas of Focus

| Worker Reconnection System | Hardware-Aware Fault Tolerance System |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Network interruptions | Hardware failures |
| Connection quality issues | Resource exhaustion |
| WebSocket failures | Browser/GPU context failures |
| State synchronization | Task retry strategies |
| Connection recovery | Hardware fallback strategies |

### Coordinated Recovery

The two systems work together to provide coordinated recovery from complex failure scenarios:

1. When a network interruption occurs, the Worker Reconnection System handles reconnection and state synchronization.
2. If a hardware failure occurs during task execution, the Hardware-Aware Fault Tolerance System determines the appropriate recovery strategy.
3. The Worker Reconnection System ensures that the recovery action is communicated to the coordinator, even if temporary network issues occur.
4. Both systems maintain a consistent view of task state and execution history for reliable recovery.

## Usage Guide

### Basic Integration

To integrate the worker reconnection system with your worker implementation:

```python
from duckdb_api.distributed_testing.worker_reconnection import (
    create_worker_reconnection_plugin
)

# Create a worker instance
worker = MyWorkerImplementation(
    worker_id="worker-123",
    coordinator_url="http://coordinator.example.com:8080",
    api_key="my-api-key",
    capabilities={"hardware": ["cpu", "cuda"]}
)

# Create reconnection plugin
reconnection_plugin = create_worker_reconnection_plugin(worker)

# Start worker (plugin is already started)
worker.start()

# When shutting down
worker.stop()
reconnection_plugin.stop()
```

### Custom Configuration

You can customize the reconnection behavior with your own configuration:

```python
# Custom configuration in worker class
class MyWorkerImplementation:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, coordinator_url, api_key, capabilities):
        self.worker_id = worker_id
        self.coordinator_url = coordinator_url
        self.api_key = api_key
        self.capabilities = capabilities
        
        # Custom reconnection configuration
        self.reconnection_config = {
            "heartbeat_interval": 3.0,            # Heartbeat every 3 seconds
            "initial_reconnect_delay": 0.5,       # Start with 0.5 second delay
            "max_reconnect_delay": 30.0,          # Maximum 30 second delay
            "reconnect_jitter": 0.1,              # 10% jitter for reconnection timing
            "heartbeat_timeout": 10.0,            # Reconnect if no heartbeat for 10 seconds
            "max_reconnect_attempts": 0,          # Unlimited reconnection attempts
            "checkpoint_interval": 600,           # Checkpoint every 10 minutes
            "connection_health_threshold": 0.8,   # Connection stability threshold
            "message_retry_count": 5              # Retry messages 5 times
        }
```

### Task Execution with Checkpointing

For long-running tasks, you can implement checkpointing to enable recovery after reconnection:

```python
# In worker implementation
def execute_task(self, task_id, task_config):
    # Initialize task
    model = load_model(task_config["model"])
    dataset = load_dataset(task_config["dataset"])
    total_steps = len(dataset)
    completed_steps = 0
    
    # Check for existing checkpoint
    checkpoint = self.reconnection_plugin.get_latest_checkpoint(task_id)
    if checkpoint:
        # Resume from checkpoint
        completed_steps = checkpoint.get("completed_steps", 0)
        model.load_state_dict(checkpoint.get("model_state", {}))
        
    # Update task state
    self.reconnection_plugin.update_task_state(task_id, {
        "status": "running",
        "total_steps": total_steps,
        "completed_steps": completed_steps
    })
    
    # Execute task with periodic checkpointing
    for step in range(completed_steps, total_steps):
        # Process step
        batch = dataset[step]
        output = model(batch)
        metrics = calculate_metrics(output, batch)
        
        # Update progress
        completed_steps = step + 1
        self.reconnection_plugin.update_task_state(task_id, {
            "completed_steps": completed_steps,
            "progress": completed_steps / total_steps,
            "current_metrics": metrics
        })
        
        # Create checkpoint every 100 steps
        if step % 100 == 0:
            checkpoint_data = {
                "model_state": model.state_dict(),
                "completed_steps": completed_steps,
                "metrics": metrics
            }
            self.reconnection_plugin.create_checkpoint(task_id, checkpoint_data)
    
    # Return final result
    return {
        "completed_steps": completed_steps,
        "final_metrics": metrics
    }
```

### Monitoring Connection Quality

You can monitor connection quality to adapt behavior based on network conditions:

```python
# Check connection status
if reconnection_plugin.is_connected():
    print("Connected to coordinator")
else:
    print("Not connected to coordinator")

# Get detailed connection statistics
stats = reconnection_plugin.get_connection_stats()
print(f"Connection stability: {stats.connection_stability:.2f}")
print(f"Average latency: {stats.average_latency:.2f}ms")
print(f"Connection success rate: {stats.connection_success_rate:.2f}")

# Adapt behavior based on connection quality
if stats.connection_stability < 0.5:
    print("Poor connection stability, increasing checkpoint frequency")
    checkpoint_interval = 50  # More frequent checkpoints
else:
    checkpoint_interval = 100  # Normal checkpoint frequency
```

### Force Reconnection

You can force a reconnection if you detect issues with the current connection:

```python
# Force reconnection
reconnection_plugin.force_reconnect()

# Wait for reconnection to complete
import time
max_wait = 30
start_time = time.time()
while not reconnection_plugin.is_connected() and time.time() - start_time < max_wait:
    time.sleep(0.5)

if reconnection_plugin.is_connected():
    print("Reconnection successful")
else:
    print("Reconnection failed after waiting")
```

## Implementation Details

### WebSocket Connection Management

The system implements a robust WebSocket connection management approach:

1. **Connection Establishment**:
   - The WebSocket connection runs in a dedicated thread
   - Authentication headers are automatically included
   - Connection timeouts are handled gracefully

2. **Heartbeat Protocol**:
   - Bidirectional heartbeats ensure connection health
   - Sequence numbers enable round-trip time measurement
   - Missing heartbeats trigger automatic reconnection

3. **Native Ping/Pong Support**:
   - Uses WebSocket protocol ping/pong frames
   - Provides lower-level connection health monitoring
   - Operates independently of application-level heartbeats

4. **Message Queuing**:
   - Outgoing messages are queued for reliable delivery
   - Messages are persisted during disconnection
   - Priority ordering ensures critical messages are sent first

### Reconnection Strategy

The reconnection strategy implements a sophisticated approach to handling network issues:

1. **Exponential Backoff**:
   - Initial delay starts small for quick recovery from brief interruptions
   - Delay increases exponentially for persistent issues
   - Maximum delay prevents excessive waiting

2. **Jitter Implementation**:
   - Random jitter prevents reconnection storms
   - Configurable jitter factor (±10-20% by default)
   - Gradual spreading of reconnection attempts

3. **Connection State Tracking**:
   - Clear state transitions (CONNECTED → DISCONNECTED → CONNECTING)
   - History-aware reconnection (tracks previous connection attempts)
   - Configurable maximum retry limit

4. **Graceful Degradation**:
   - Progressive increase in retry intervals
   - Automatic transition to FAILED state after max retries
   - Clear reporting of connection status for user feedback

### State Synchronization

The state synchronization mechanism ensures consistent state after reconnection:

1. **Task State Tracking**:
   - Maintains complete task execution state locally
   - Implements incremental state updates during execution
   - Provides full state reconstruction after reconnection

2. **Result Resubmission**:
   - Caches task results during disconnection
   - Resubmits results automatically after reconnection
   - Handles duplicate result detection gracefully

3. **Checkpoint Management**:
   - Periodic checkpointing based on configurable interval
   - Efficient checkpoint storage with minimal memory footprint
   - Checkpoint lifecycle management (creation, retrieval, pruning)

4. **Synchronization Protocol**:
   - Batched synchronization to avoid overwhelming the coordinator
   - Prioritized synchronization of critical state information
   - Progressive synchronization for large state volumes

## Real-World Example: Network Outage Recovery

Consider a scenario where a worker is running a long benchmark task when the network connection to the coordinator is lost:

1. **During Connection**:
   - Worker is executing a benchmark task and creating periodic checkpoints
   - The latest checkpoint contains progress at step 850/1000
   - Connection quality metrics show stable connection

2. **Connection Lost**:
   - Network connection drops at step 875
   - Worker detects missing heartbeats
   - Connection state transitions to DISCONNECTED
   - Worker continues executing the task while attempting reconnection

3. **Reconnection Attempts**:
   - First attempt starts immediately, fails
   - Second attempt starts after 2 seconds (with jitter), fails
   - Third attempt starts after 4 seconds (with jitter), fails
   - Subsequent attempts with increasing delays...

4. **Task Completion During Disconnection**:
   - Worker completes the task at step 1000
   - Results are cached locally
   - Final checkpoint is created locally
   - Reconnection attempts continue

5. **Successful Reconnection**:
   - After 45 seconds, the network connection is restored
   - A reconnection attempt succeeds
   - Connection state transitions to CONNECTED
   - Registration message is sent to coordinator

6. **State Synchronization**:
   - Worker synchronizes state with coordinator
   - Cached task result is submitted
   - Checkpoints are available for coordinator retrieval
   - Task state is fully synchronized

7. **Return to Normal Operation**:
   - Coordinator acknowledges the task result
   - Worker is ready to accept new tasks
   - Connection quality metrics are updated

Throughout this process, the worker reconnection system has:
- Maintained execution continuity despite network disruption
- Preserved all task results and checkpoints
- Automatically recovered the connection when possible
- Synchronized state to ensure consistency with the coordinator

   - Parallel connection attempts over different network interfaces
   - Dynamic protocol switching based on network conditions

4. **Advanced Telemetry**
   - Detailed connection quality metrics and visualization
   - Historical connection reliability tracking
   - Network environment fingerprinting

5. **Mobile-Optimized Reconnection**
   - Special handling for mobile network transitions (WiFi ↔ Cellular)
   - Battery-aware reconnection strategies
   - Bandwidth-efficient state synchronization

## Conclusion
