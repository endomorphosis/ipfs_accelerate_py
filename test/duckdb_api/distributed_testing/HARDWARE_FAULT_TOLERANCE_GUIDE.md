## Architecture

The fault tolerance system consists of the following core components:

### 1. HardwareAwareFaultToleranceManager

The central component that orchestrates fault tolerance operations:

- Tracks task state, failure history, and recovery actions
- Manages checkpoints and state persistence
- Analyzes failures to determine appropriate recovery strategies
- Integrates with the coordinator and heterogeneous scheduler

### 2. Failure Types and Recovery Strategies

The system defines a comprehensive taxonomy of failure types and recovery strategies:

**Failure Types**:
- Hardware errors (GPU crashes, TPU failures)
- Software errors (runtime exceptions)
- Resource exhaustion (out of memory, disk space)
- Timeouts
- Communication errors
- Browser failures (WebGPU context lost)
- Worker crashes and disconnections

**Recovery Strategies**:
- Immediate retry on the same worker
- Delayed retry with exponential backoff
- Retry on a different worker with similar capabilities
- Switch to a different hardware class
- Reduce precision (e.g., fp32 → fp16 → int8)
- Reduce batch size
- Fallback to CPU execution
- Browser restart for WebGPU/WebNN
- Human escalation for persistent issues

### 3. Failure Context and Recovery Actions

- `FailureContext`: Captures complete information about a failure (task, worker, hardware, error)
- `RecoveryAction`: Defines the action to take to recover from a failure

### 4. Failure Pattern Detection

The system includes a sophisticated pattern detection mechanism that:

- Analyzes historical failures to identify recurring patterns
- Groups failures by hardware type, error type, and worker instance
- Establishes thresholds for pattern recognition
- Recommends appropriate actions for addressing systemic issues

### 5. Checkpoint Management

Built-in checkpoint capabilities for task state persistence:

- Periodic checkpointing based on configurable intervals
- State synchronization with database for persistence
- Task resumption from the most recent checkpoint

## Usage Guide

### Basic Integration

To integrate the hardware-aware fault tolerance system with your distributed testing environment:

```python
from duckdb_api.distributed_testing.hardware_aware_fault_tolerance import (
    create_recovery_manager, apply_recovery_action
)

# Create a recovery manager
recovery_manager = create_recovery_manager(
    coordinator=coordinator,  # Your coordinator instance
    db_manager=db_manager,    # Your database manager
    scheduler=scheduler,      # Your heterogeneous scheduler
    enable_ml=True            # Enable machine learning-based pattern detection
)

# Handle a task failure
def on_task_failure(task_id, worker_id, error_info):
    # Determine recovery action
    recovery_action = recovery_manager.handle_failure(
        task_id=task_id,
        worker_id=worker_id,
        error_info=error_info
    )
    
    # Apply the recovery action
    apply_recovery_action(
        task_id=task_id,
        action=recovery_action,
        coordinator=coordinator,
        scheduler=scheduler
    )
```

### Custom Configuration

You can customize the fault tolerance system with your own configuration:

```python
# Create a manager with custom configuration
manager = create_recovery_manager(coordinator=coordinator)

# Update the configuration
manager.configure({
    "max_retries": 5,  # Maximum retry attempts
    "base_delay": 1.0,  # Base delay for retries (seconds)
    "max_delay": 30.0,  # Maximum delay for retries (seconds)
    "checkpoint_interval": 600,  # Checkpoint every 10 minutes
    "failure_pattern_threshold": 5,  # Threshold for pattern detection
    "recovery_strategies": {
        # Custom strategy order for each hardware class
        "GPU": [
            RecoveryStrategy.DIFFERENT_WORKER,
            RecoveryStrategy.REDUCED_PRECISION,
            RecoveryStrategy.FALLBACK_CPU
        ],
        # Add more customizations for other hardware classes
    }
})
```

### Task State and Checkpoints

You can work with task state and checkpoints directly:

```python
# Get current state of a task
task_state = recovery_manager.get_task_state(task_id)

# Update task state
recovery_manager.update_task_state(task_id, {
    "progress": 75,
    "completed_steps": 150,
    "current_phase": "validation"
})

# Create a checkpoint
checkpoint_data = {
    "model_state": model.state_dict(),
    "optimizer_state": optimizer.state_dict(),
    "epoch": current_epoch,
    "batch_idx": current_batch,
    "metrics": current_metrics
}
checkpoint_id = recovery_manager.create_checkpoint(task_id, checkpoint_data)

# Get the latest checkpoint for a task
latest_checkpoint = recovery_manager.get_latest_checkpoint(task_id)
if latest_checkpoint:
    # Resume from checkpoint
    model.load_state_dict(latest_checkpoint["model_state"])
    optimizer.load_state_dict(latest_checkpoint["optimizer_state"])
    start_epoch = latest_checkpoint["epoch"]
    start_batch = latest_checkpoint["batch_idx"]
```

### Failure Pattern Analysis

You can access and analyze detected failure patterns:

```python
# Get all detected failure patterns
patterns = recovery_manager.get_failure_patterns()

# Analyze patterns to identify systemic issues
for pattern_id, pattern in patterns.items():
    pattern_type = pattern["type"]  # "hardware_class", "error_type", "worker_id"
    pattern_key = pattern["key"]    # The specific value of the type
    count = pattern["count"]        # Number of failures in this pattern
    recommended_action = pattern["recommended_action"]
    
    print(f"Detected pattern: {pattern_type}={pattern_key}, count={count}")
    print(f"Recommended action: {recommended_action}")
    
    # Take appropriate action based on the pattern
    if pattern_type == "worker_id":
        # Consider taking the worker offline for investigation
        coordinator.disable_worker(pattern_key)
    elif pattern_type == "hardware_class" and pattern_key == "GPU":
        # Consider using CPU workers for affected tasks
        scheduler.update_hardware_preferences({"prefer_cpu": True})
```

### ML-Based Pattern Detection

When the ML-based pattern detection is enabled, you can also work with machine learning patterns:

```python
# Get ML-based patterns
if recovery_manager.enable_ml and recovery_manager.ml_detector:
    ml_patterns = recovery_manager.ml_detector.detect_patterns()
    
    # Process ML-detected patterns
    for pattern in ml_patterns:
        pattern_type = pattern["type"]  # "ml_cluster", "rapid_failure", etc.
        confidence = pattern["confidence"]  # Confidence score (0.0 to 1.0)
        description = pattern["description"]
        
        print(f"ML Pattern ({confidence:.2f}): {description}")
        
        # Take action based on pattern type and confidence
        if pattern_type == "ml_cluster" and confidence > 0.8:
            # High-confidence cluster pattern
            if "hardware_class" in pattern and pattern["hardware_class"] == "GPU":
                # GPU-related pattern
                scheduler.deprioritize_hardware_class("GPU")
        
        elif pattern_type == "rapid_failure" and confidence > 0.7:
            # Tasks failing in rapid succession
            task_id = pattern["task_id"]
            coordinator.pause_task(task_id)
            print(f"Paused task {task_id} due to rapid failures")
```

### Recovery History Analysis

You can analyze the recovery history for a task:

```python
# Get recovery history for a task
recovery_history = recovery_manager.get_recovery_history(task_id)

# Analyze recovery attempts
for i, action in enumerate(recovery_history):
    print(f"Recovery attempt {i+1}: {action.strategy.name}")
    print(f"Message: {action.message}")
    
    # Count strategies by type
    strategy_counts = {}
    for a in recovery_history:
        strategy = a.strategy.name
        strategy_counts[strategy] = strategy_counts.get(strategy, 0) + 1
    
    print("Strategy distribution:")
    for strategy, count in strategy_counts.items():
        print(f"  {strategy}: {count}")
```

## Examples

### Handling GPU Out-of-Memory Errors

```python
# Task configuration with large batch size
task_config = {
    "model": "bert-large-uncased",
    "batch_size": 32,
    "precision": "fp16",
    "sequence_length": 512
}

# Create task
task_id = coordinator.add_task("benchmark", task_config)

# When an OOM error occurs
error_info = {
    "message": "CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 2.00 GiB.",
    "type": "cuda_error"
}

# Handle the failure
recovery_action = recovery_manager.handle_failure(task_id, worker_id, error_info)

# The system will automatically:
# 1. Reduce the batch size (32 → 16)
# 2. Update the task configuration
# 3. Retry the task with the new configuration
apply_recovery_action(task_id, recovery_action, coordinator)

# If it fails again, the system will:
# 1. Further reduce precision (fp16 → int8)
# 2. Update the task configuration
# 3. Retry the task with the new configuration

# If it still fails, the system will:
# 1. Fall back to CPU execution
# 2. Update the hardware requirements
# 3. Retry the task on a CPU worker
```

### Handling WebGPU Browser Crashes

```python
# Task configuration for WebGPU
task_config = {
    "model": "mobilenet_v2",
    "batch_size": 8,
    "browser": "chrome"
}

# Create task
task_id = coordinator.add_task("image_classification", task_config)

# When a browser crash occurs
error_info = {
    "message": "browser crash detected",
    "type": "browser_error"
}

# Handle the failure
recovery_action = recovery_manager.handle_failure(task_id, worker_id, error_info)

# The system will automatically:
# 1. Restart the browser
# 2. Retry the task on the same worker
apply_recovery_action(task_id, recovery_action, coordinator)

# If it fails again, the system will:
# 1. Try a different browser/worker
# 2. Retry the task on the new worker

# If it still fails, the system will:
# 1. Fall back to CPU execution
# 2. Update the hardware requirements
# 3. Retry the task on a CPU worker
```

### Long-Running Task with Checkpoints

```python
# Configure task for long training run
task_config = {
    "model": "t5-large",
    "epochs": 10,
    "checkpoint_every_n_steps": 1000
}

# Create task
task_id = coordinator.add_task("fine_tuning", task_config)

# During task execution, periodically create checkpoints
for epoch in range(10):
    for batch_idx, batch in enumerate(data_loader):
        # Training code...
        
        # Create checkpoint every 1000 steps
        if batch_idx % 1000 == 0:
            checkpoint_data = {
                "model_state": model.state_dict(),
                "optimizer_state": optimizer.state_dict(),
                "epoch": epoch,
                "batch_idx": batch_idx,
                "metrics": current_metrics
            }
            recovery_manager.create_checkpoint(task_id, checkpoint_data)
        
        # If a failure occurs, the system can resume from the last checkpoint
        # The checkpoint_loop background thread in the recovery manager will
        # automatically create checkpoints based on the configured interval
```

## Integration with Distributed Testing Framework

The hardware-aware fault tolerance system is designed to integrate seamlessly with the existing Distributed Testing Framework:

1. **Coordinator Integration**
   - The recovery manager interacts with the coordinator to manage tasks and workers
   - Recovery actions are applied through the coordinator's API
   - Task state and recovery history are tracked alongside the coordinator's state

2. **Heterogeneous Scheduler Integration**
   - Recovery strategies consider hardware capabilities and affinities
   - The system can update task requirements based on recovery needs
   - Hardware-specific failures inform future scheduling decisions

3. **Database Integration**
   - Task state, failure patterns, and checkpoints are persisted in the database
   - The system can recover state after restarts or crashes

## Implementation Status

The hardware-aware fault tolerance system has been fully implemented and tested. All planned features are complete and operational, including:

- ✅ Hardware-specific recovery strategies for different hardware types
- ✅ Intelligent retry policies with exponential backoff and jitter
- ✅ Failure pattern detection and prevention
- ✅ Task state persistence and recovery
- ✅ Checkpoint and resume for long-running tasks
- ✅ Integration with heterogeneous hardware scheduler
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite validating all components

The system was completed ahead of schedule (March 13, 2025 vs. planned June 12-19, 2025), demonstrating the efficiency and capability of the development team. On the same day, we also added Machine Learning-based pattern detection capabilities, which was originally planned as a future enhancement.

## Machine Learning-Based Pattern Detection

The system now includes advanced pattern detection using machine learning techniques to identify subtle correlations between failures:

- **Feature extraction** from failure contexts (hardware types, error messages, etc.)
- **Clustering of similar failures** for more accurate pattern detection
- **Success rate tracking** for different recovery strategies
- **Recovery strategy recommendation** based on historical success rates
- **Automatic adaptation** to patterns as they emerge

This ML-based system works alongside the traditional pattern detection, providing an extra layer of intelligence for handling failures.

## Auto Recovery System and High Availability Clustering

The Distributed Testing Framework now includes an advanced **Auto Recovery System** that provides high availability clustering and coordinator redundancy. This feature enables continuous operation even when individual coordinator nodes fail, ensuring uninterrupted test execution and reliable system performance.

## Overview

The High Availability Clustering feature enhances the framework with:

## Architecture

The High Availability Clustering system uses a state machine architecture with four coordinator states:

1. **Leader**: Primary coordinator that handles task distribution and worker management
2. **Follower**: Secondary coordinator that receives updates from the leader
3. **Candidate**: Coordinator seeking election as leader during election periods
4. **Offline**: Coordinator that is not responding or is disconnected from the cluster

### Leader Election Process

The cluster uses a Raft-inspired consensus algorithm for leader election:

1. All nodes start as followers
2. Each follower has a randomized election timeout (150-300ms by default)
3. When a follower's timeout expires without receiving leader heartbeats, it:
   - Transitions to the candidate state
   - Increments its term number
   - Votes for itself
   - Requests votes from other nodes in the cluster
4. If a candidate receives votes from a majority of nodes, it becomes the leader
5. The leader sends regular heartbeats to all followers to maintain its leadership
6. If the leader fails, followers will detect the absence of heartbeats and initiate a new election
7. Randomized timeouts help prevent split votes and ensure eventual consensus

### State Replication

To maintain consistency across the cluster, state is replicated between coordinator nodes:

1. **Log-Based Replication**:
   - Leader maintains a log of all state changes
   - Changes are sent to followers as append entries
   - Followers acknowledge receipt and application of entries
   - Leader commits entries when acknowledged by a majority

2. **State Snapshots**:
   - Periodic full state snapshots are created
   - Snapshots provide efficient state transfer for new or lagging nodes
   - Snapshots include complete task, worker, and system state

3. **Consistency Guarantees**:
   - Strong consistency for committed entries
   - Eventual consistency during leader transitions
   - Automatic conflict resolution based on term numbers

### Health Monitoring System

The Auto Recovery System includes comprehensive health monitoring:

1. **Metric Collection**:
   - CPU usage tracking (overall and per-core)
   - Memory usage and availability monitoring
   - Disk space and I/O monitoring
   - Network bandwidth and connectivity monitoring
   - Error rate and performance metric tracking

2. **Proactive Health Management**:
   - **Memory Management**: 
     - Garbage collection triggering
     - Memory pool optimization
     - Object caching control
   - **Disk Management**:
     - Log rotation and cleanup
     - Temporary file removal
     - Disk usage optimization
   - **CPU Management**:
     - Workload distribution adjustment
     - Priority-based scheduling
     - Background task throttling

3. **Self-Healing Actions**:
   - Automatic resource constraint resolution
   - Leader step-down when resources are critically constrained
   - Workload redistribution during resource pressure
   - Connection pool management and optimization

4. **Health Status Broadcasting**:
   - Regular health status updates to all cluster nodes
   - Health metric aggregation at the leader node
   - Cluster-wide health visualization and reporting

## Usage Guide

### Basic Integration

To integrate the Auto Recovery System with your coordinator setup:

```python
from duckdb_api.distributed_testing.auto_recovery import AutoRecoverySystem

# Create the auto recovery system
auto_recovery = AutoRecoverySystem(
    coordinator_id="coordinator-1",
    coordinator_addresses=["localhost:8081", "localhost:8082"],
    db_path="./benchmark_db.duckdb",

```

### Leader Election Callbacks

You can register callbacks for leader transition events:

```python
def on_become_leader():
    """Called when this coordinator becomes the leader."""
    print("I am now the leader!")
    # Initialize leader-specific components
    initialize_as_leader()
    
def on_leader_changed(old_leader_id, new_leader_id):
    """Called when the leader changes."""
    print(f"Leader changed from {old_leader_id} to {new_leader_id}")
    # Update references to the leader
    update_leader_reference(new_leader_id)

# Register callbacks
auto_recovery.register_become_leader_callback(on_become_leader)
auto_recovery.register_leader_changed_callback(on_leader_changed)
```

### Health Monitoring

You can access health metrics and configure thresholds:

```python
# Get current health metrics
health_metrics = auto_recovery.get_health_metrics()
print(f"CPU Usage: {health_metrics['cpu_usage']}%")
print(f"Memory Usage: {health_metrics['memory_usage']}%")
print(f"Disk Usage: {health_metrics['disk_usage']}%")
print(f"Network Usage: {health_metrics['network_usage_mbps']} Mbps")
print(f"Error Rate: {health_metrics['error_rate']} errors/minute")

# Configure health thresholds
auto_recovery.configure_health_monitoring(
    cpu_threshold=90.0,
    memory_threshold=85.0,
    disk_threshold=90.0,
    error_rate_threshold=10.0
)

# Manually trigger health actions
auto_recovery.free_memory()  # Force garbage collection
auto_recovery.free_disk_space()  # Remove temporary files
```

### WebNN/WebGPU Capability Detection

You can access WebNN/WebGPU capability information:

```python
# Get web capabilities
web_capabilities = auto_recovery.get_web_capabilities()
print(f"WebNN supported: {web_capabilities['webnn_supported']}")
print(f"WebGPU supported: {web_capabilities['webgpu_supported']}")

# Get browser-specific capabilities
for browser, caps in web_capabilities['browsers'].items():
    print(f"{browser}: WebNN={caps['webnn_supported']}, WebGPU={caps['webgpu_supported']}")
    
    # Check specific WebGPU features
    if 'webgpu_features' in caps:
        print(f"  Storage Tier 2: {caps['webgpu_features'].get('storage_tier_2', False)}")
        print(f"  Compute Shader: {caps['webgpu_features'].get('compute_shader', False)}")
        print(f"  Shader Precompilation: {caps['webgpu_features'].get('shader_precompilation', False)}")
        
    # Check specific WebNN features
    if 'webnn_features' in caps:
        print(f"  Hardware Acceleration: {caps['webnn_features'].get('hardware_acceleration', False)}")
        print(f"  Float16 Support: {caps['webnn_features'].get('float16_support', False)}")
```

### Visualization Generation

You can manually generate visualizations:

```python
# Generate all visualizations
auto_recovery.generate_all_visualizations()

# Generate specific visualizations
auto_recovery.generate_cluster_status_visualization()
auto_recovery.generate_health_metrics_visualization()
auto_recovery.generate_leader_transition_visualization()

# Generate visualization with custom file name
auto_recovery.generate_cluster_status_visualization(file_name="coordinator_status.html")

# Open visualization in browser
import webbrowser
webbrowser.open(f"file://{os.path.abspath('visualizations/coordinator_status.html')}")
```

### Message Integrity Verification

The Auto Recovery System includes message integrity verification:

```python
# Create a message with integrity verification
message = {
    "type": "health_update",
    "coordinator_id": "coordinator-1",
    "timestamp": "2025-03-16T20:45:04",
    "health_metrics": {
        "cpu_usage": 45.2,
        "memory_usage": 60.7,
        "disk_usage": 75.3
    }
}

# Add hash for integrity verification
message["hash"] = auto_recovery._hash_data(message)

# Verify message integrity
is_valid = auto_recovery.verify_message_integrity(message)
print(f"Message integrity: {is_valid}")
```

### State Synchronization

You can manually trigger state synchronization:

```python
# Sync with the leader
success = auto_recovery.sync_with_leader()
if success:
    print("Successfully synchronized with leader")
else:
    print("Failed to synchronize with leader")

# Create a state snapshot
snapshot_id = auto_recovery.create_state_snapshot()
print(f"Created state snapshot: {snapshot_id}")

# Apply a state snapshot
success = auto_recovery.apply_state_snapshot(snapshot_id)
if success:
    print(f"Successfully applied snapshot {snapshot_id}")
else:
    print(f"Failed to apply snapshot {snapshot_id}")
```

## Example Scripts

### High Availability Cluster Example

The framework includes a comprehensive example of a high availability cluster that demonstrates all features:

```bash
# Run a basic cluster with 3 nodes
./run_high_availability_cluster.sh --nodes 3

# Run with fault injection to test failover
./run_high_availability_cluster.sh --nodes 3 --fault-injection

# Customize ports and runtime
./run_high_availability_cluster.sh --nodes 5 --base-port 9000 --runtime 300
```

This example creates a cluster of coordinator nodes that:
- Automatically elect a leader using the consensus algorithm
- Replicate state between coordinators for consistency
- Demonstrate automatic recovery from node failures
- Generate visualizations of cluster state and metrics
- Monitor health and detect resource constraints
- Implement self-healing actions for resource issues
- Detect WebNN/WebGPU capabilities for browser integration

### Manual Cluster Setup

Alternatively, you can start multiple coordinator instances manually:

```bash
# Start the first coordinator
python duckdb_api/distributed_testing/run_integrated_system.py --high-availability --coordinator-id coordinator1

# Start additional coordinators
python duckdb_api/distributed_testing/run_integrated_system.py --port 8081 --high-availability --coordinator-id coordinator2 --coordinator-addresses localhost:8080
python duckdb_api/distributed_testing/run_integrated_system.py --port 8082 --high-availability --coordinator-id coordinator3 --coordinator-addresses localhost:8080,localhost:8081
```

### Custom Visualization Script

For standalone visualization of a high availability cluster:

```bash
# Generate visualizations for an existing cluster
python duckdb_api/distributed_testing/examples/ha_visualizer.py

# Specify custom input and output directories
python duckdb_api/distributed_testing/examples/ha_visualizer.py --cluster-dir /path/to/cluster --output-dir /path/to/visualizations
```

The visualizer creates:
- Cluster status visualization with node roles
- Health metrics visualization with resource usage
- Leader transition history in Markdown format

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Leader Election Failures**
   - **Symptom**: Coordinators repeatedly initiate elections without settling on a leader
   - **Causes**: Network connectivity issues, clock skew between nodes, port conflicts
   - **Solution**: 
     - Check network connectivity between coordinator nodes
     - Ensure clocks are synchronized across nodes
     - Verify that ports are accessible and not blocked by firewalls
     - Check logs for election timeout issues and adjust timeouts if needed
     - Ensure majority of nodes are available (at least N/2+1 for N nodes)

2. **State Synchronization Issues**
   - **Symptom**: Coordinators have inconsistent state after failover
   - **Causes**: Incomplete log replication, errors during state transfer, network issues
   - **Solution**: 
     - Check network connectivity between nodes
     - Increase log replication timeout in configuration
     - Verify database access permissions
     - Check logs for synchronization errors
     - Try manual synchronization with explicit sync command

3. **Health Monitoring Errors**
   - **Symptom**: Missing or incorrect health metrics
   - **Causes**: Missing psutil dependency, insufficient permissions, OS restrictions
   - **Solution**: 
     - Install psutil package (`pip install psutil>=5.9.0`)
     - Ensure the process has sufficient permissions to read system metrics
     - Check logs for specific monitoring errors
     - Try running with elevated permissions if needed

4. **Visualization Failures**
   - **Symptom**: Visualizations not generated or empty
   - **Causes**: Missing matplotlib/networkx dependencies, invalid visualization path, permissions
   - **Solution**: 
     - Install visualization dependencies (`pip install matplotlib>=3.5.0 networkx>=2.6.0`)
     - Check visualization path exists and has write permissions
     - Verify that the user running the process has graphics capabilities
     - Look for text-based alternatives in the logs

5. **WebNN/WebGPU Detection Issues**
   - **Symptom**: Browser capabilities not detected or incorrect
   - **Causes**: Missing Selenium, browser driver issues, compatibility problems
   - **Solution**: 
     - Install Selenium (`pip install selenium>=4.8.0`)
     - Ensure the appropriate browser driver is installed and in the PATH
     - Check browser version compatibility
     - Try the system with a newer browser version

### Logs and Debugging

The Auto Recovery System provides detailed logging for troubleshooting:

```python
# Enable debug logging
import logging
logging.getLogger("auto_recovery").setLevel(logging.DEBUG)

# Log to file
file_handler = logging.FileHandler("auto_recovery.log")
file_handler.setFormatter(logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - [%(name)s] - %(message)s'))
logging.getLogger("auto_recovery").addHandler(file_handler)
```

Key log messages to look for:

- `"Starting leader election for term X"`: Indicates a new election
- `"Received vote from Y for term X"`: Shows voting progress
- `"Transitioning to leader for term X"`: Indicates successful election
- `"Sending AppendEntries to all followers"`: Normal leader operation
- `"Warning: High CPU/memory/disk usage"`: Resource constraint detected
- `"Applying recovery action: X"`: Self-healing in progress
- `"Updated web capabilities: WebNN=X, WebGPU=Y"`: Browser capability detection

### Checking Cluster Status

To check the status of the Auto Recovery System:

```python
# Check coordinator state
print(f"Coordinator ID: {auto_recovery.coordinator_id}")
print(f"Current state: {auto_recovery.auto_recovery.status}")
print(f"Current term: {auto_recovery.auto_recovery.term}")
print(f"Current leader: {auto_recovery.auto_recovery.leader_id}")

# Get list of coordinators in the cluster
for coordinator_id, info in auto_recovery.auto_recovery.coordinators.items():
    print(f"Coordinator: {coordinator_id}")
    print(f"  Address: {info.get('address')}:{info.get('port')}")
    print(f"  Status: {info.get('status')}")
    print(f"  Last Heartbeat: {info.get('last_heartbeat')}")
```

## Advanced Features

### Custom Leader Election Strategy

You can customize the leader election strategy by extending the AutoRecovery class:

```python
class CustomAutoRecovery(AutoRecovery):
    def _get_random_election_timeout(self) -> int:
        """Custom election timeout strategy."""
        # Use a different timeout range
        min_timeout = 200
        max_timeout = 400
        return random.randint(min_timeout, max_timeout)
    
    def _check_leader_status(self) -> bool:
        """Custom leader check that considers additional factors."""
        # Check basic leader status
        basic_status = super()._check_leader_status()
        
        # Add custom checks (e.g., performance metrics)
        if basic_status and self.is_leader():
            # Step down if CPU usage is too high
            if self.get_cpu_usage() > 95.0:
                logger.warning("CPU usage too high, stepping down as leader")
                return False
        
        return basic_status
```

### Custom Recovery Strategies

You can implement custom recovery strategies for resource constraints:

```python
class EnhancedAutoRecoverySystem(AutoRecoverySystem):
    def _free_memory(self) -> float:
        """Enhanced memory optimization strategy."""
        # Call base implementation first
        freed_base = super()._free_memory()
        
        # Add custom memory optimization
        freed_custom = 0.0
        
        # Example: Clear custom caches
        if hasattr(self, 'result_cache') and self.result_cache:
            cache_size = len(self.result_cache)
            self.result_cache.clear()
            freed_custom += cache_size * 0.1  # Approximate MB per cache entry
            
        logger.info(f"Enhanced memory optimization freed {freed_custom:.2f} MB")
        return freed_base + freed_custom
```

### Browser-Specific WebGPU/WebNN Optimization

You can extend the framework with browser-specific optimizations:

```python
class BrowserOptimizedAutoRecoverySystem(AutoRecoverySystem):
    def _update_web_capabilities(self):
        """Enhanced web capability detection with browser-specific optimizations."""
        # Call base implementation first
        super()._update_web_capabilities()
        
        # Add browser-specific optimizations
        for browser, caps in self.web_capabilities.get('browsers', {}).items():
            if browser.lower() == 'firefox' and caps.get('webgpu_supported'):
                # Firefox-specific optimizations for audio models
                caps['recommended_models'] = {
                    'audio': ['whisper', 'wav2vec2', 'clap'],
                }
                caps['optimization_flags'] = {
                    'compute_shaders': True,
                    'workgroup_size': '256x1x1'
                }
                
            elif browser.lower() == 'edge' and caps.get('webnn_supported'):
                # Edge-specific optimizations for WebNN
                caps['recommended_models'] = {
                    'text': ['bert', 't5'],
                }
