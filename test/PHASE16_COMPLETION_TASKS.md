### 2. Documentation of Current Hardware and Model Status

Status: ✅ Complete (March 5, 2025)

Documentation of the current hardware backend and HuggingFace model coverage has been completed. Key findings:

- All 13 key model families have implementations with varying levels of hardware support
- Complete CUDA support (100%) for all model families
- Strong support for CPU, ROCm, MPS, and OpenVINO (80-100%)
- More limited support for WebNN and WebGPU (34%), primarily due to browser constraints
- Database migration is 100% complete with all 17 scripts successfully migrated or archived

Documentation has been consolidated in DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md with detailed hardware backend support and model coverage information. Cross-references to detailed reports have been added.

### 3. Phase 17 Planning

Task Breakdown:
1. Create detailed implementation plan for Phase 17
2. Establish milestones and deliverables
3. Define key objectives and success criteria
4. Create task breakdown with timelines
5. Review and finalize the plan

Estimated Effort: 2 days  
Estimated Completion: March 17, 2025
