    model_family="text_generation",
    model_name="llama-7b",
    batch_size=1,
    mode="inference"
)

## 6. Conclusion

Phase 16 has significantly enhanced the hardware benchmarking capabilities of the IPFS Accelerate Python Framework. The implementation of automated hardware selection, distributed training support, and performance prediction systems represents a major step forward in optimizing model performance across different hardware platforms.

The database restructuring effort has also delivered substantial improvements in test result management and analysis. The migration to DuckDB/Parquet has enabled more efficient storage, faster queries, and better visualization capabilities.

With 85% of Phase 16 completed, the remaining work focuses on refining the performance prediction system and completing the training mode test coverage. These improvements will further enhance the framework's ability to deliver optimal performance for machine learning models across diverse hardware environments.
