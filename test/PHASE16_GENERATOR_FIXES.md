## Testing

To run a comprehensive test of the generators on all key models and hardware combinations:

```bash
./run_phase16_generators.sh
```

This script will:
1. Run both test generators on the 13 key models
2. Test with different hardware configurations
3. Check that the generated files have valid Python syntax
4. Generate a summary of success rates

## Validation and Usage

The generators now produce valid test files for all models, with proper hardware detection and cross-platform support. The hardware-specific code for each platform ensures that tests can run on any available hardware.

To manually test a specific model with full cross-platform support:

```bash
# Generate a test file for a specific model with all hardware platforms
python fixed_merged_test_generator.py --generate bert --platform all --output test_hf_bert.py

# Generate a test file with specific hardware platforms
python fixed_merged_test_generator.py --generate vit --platform "cuda,openvino,qualcomm,webgpu" --output test_hf_vit.py

# Generate a test file with cross-platform flag (same as platform=all)
python fixed_merged_test_generator.py --generate clip --cross-platform --output test_hf_clip.py

# Generate a skill implementation with cross-platform support
python integrated_skillset_generator.py --model bert --hardware all --cross-platform

# Generate a skill with specific hardware platforms
python integrated_skillset_generator.py --model t5 --hardware "cpu,cuda,rocm,webnn" 
```

### Generator Improvements Example

Here's an example showing the improvements in the generators:

```python
# Before: Missing run_tests method, no model registry, no modality-specific handling
class TestBert(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.model_id = "bert"
    
    def test_cpu(self):
        # Initialize model
        self.tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(self.model_id)
        self.model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(self.model_id)
        
        # Process input
        inputs = self.tokenizer("Text input", return_tensors="pt")
        outputs = self.model(**inputs)
        
        # Validate with rigid check
        self.assertIn("last_hidden_state", outputs)

# After: Proper run_tests method, model registry, modality-specific handling
class TestBertModels(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.model_id = "bert-base-uncased"
        self.modality = "text"
    
    def run_tests(self):
        unittest.main()
    
    def test_cpu(self):
        # Initialize based on modality
        if self.modality == "text":
            self.tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(self.model_id)
            self.model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(self.model_id)
        elif self.modality == "vision":
            self.processor = AutoImageProcessor.from_pretrained(self.model_id)
            self.model = AutoModelForImageClassification.from_pretrained(self.model_id)
        # ... other modalities
        
        # Process input based on modality
        if self.modality == "text":
            inputs = self.tokenizer("Text input", return_tensors="pt")
        elif self.modality == "vision":
            from PIL import Image
            image = Image.new('RGB', (224, 224), color='white')
            inputs = self.processor(images=image, return_tensors="pt")
        # ... other modalities
        
        # Validate with flexible checks for different output structures
        self.assertIsNotNone(outputs)
        if self.modality == "text":
            if hasattr(outputs, 'last_hidden_state'):
                self.assertIsNotNone(outputs.last_hidden_state)
            else:
                self.assertTrue(any(key in outputs for key in ['last_hidden_state', 'hidden_states', 'logits']))
        # ... other modalities validation
```

Future work could include:
