## Recommendations

Based on the test results, the following recommendations are made:

- Text models (BERT, T5, LLAMA): Use WebNN with 8-bit quantization for best performance
- Vision models (CLIP, ViT, DETR): Use WebGPU with 8-bit or 16-bit quantization
- Audio models (Whisper, Wav2Vec2, CLAP): Use WebGPU with compute shader optimizations
- Multimodal models (LLaVA, XCLIP): Use WebGPU with parallel loading optimizations

For memory-constrained environments, 4-bit mixed precision provides a good balance between performance and model size.

The fixed implementation provides better error handling and consistent quantization support across all model types.
