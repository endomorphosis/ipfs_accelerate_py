## Implementation Details

The architecture consists of several key components:

1. **Hardware Detection**: `generators/hardware/hardware_detection.py` provides robust detection of available hardware.
2. **Test Generator**: `generators/test_generators/merged_test_generator.py` and `fixed_generators/test_generators/merged_test_generator.py` generate model tests.
3. **Web Platform Handler**: `fixed_web_platform/web_platform_handler.py` implements WebNN/WebGPU platforms.
4. **Benchmark System**: Benchmarks store results in DuckDB database instead of JSON files.
5. **Hardware Selection System**: Automated hardware selection based on model requirements.

## Known Implementation Issues

Several implementation issues are currently tracked:

1. **OpenVINO Implementations**:
   - T5 implementation is mocked and needs a real implementation
   - CLAP implementation is mocked and needs a real implementation 
   - Wav2Vec2 implementation is mocked and needs a real implementation

2. **WebNN/WebGPU Limitations**:
   - Large models (>1B parameters) have memory constraints
