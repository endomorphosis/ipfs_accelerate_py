# Advanced Browser Recovery Strategies

**Implementation Date:** March 19, 2025

## Overview

The Advanced Browser Recovery Strategies module enhances the Circuit Breaker pattern with sophisticated, model-aware recovery approaches tailored to different browser types. This system provides progressive recovery that intelligently escalates from simple retries to browser-specific optimizations, cross-browser fallbacks, and simulation mode as a last resort.

## Key Features

### 1. Browser-Specific Recovery Strategies

The system offers specialized strategies for each major browser:

- **Chrome**: Performance optimizations for vision models and WebNN support
- **Firefox**: Compute shader optimizations for audio models
- **Edge**: WebNN acceleration for text models
- **Safari**: Limited customization with graceful degradation

### 2. Model-Aware Recovery Approaches

Recovery strategies are optimized for different model types:

- **Text Models**: WebNN acceleration on Edge, shader precompilation, latency optimization
- **Vision Models**: WebGPU optimization, zero-copy buffer transfers, throughput focus
- **Audio Models**: Firefox compute shader optimization, workgroup size customization
- **Multimodal Models**: Parallel loading, progressive component loading, memory optimization

### 3. Progressive Recovery with Escalation

Recovery follows a progressive approach with increasing intervention levels:

1. **Minimal**: Simple retries with exponential backoff
2. **Moderate**: Browser restart with preserved arguments
3. **Aggressive**: Browser setting adjustments based on failure type
4. **Fallback**: Switch to different browser optimized for model type
5. **Simulation**: Fall back to simulation mode when hardware fails

### 4. Resource-Aware Recovery

Recovery strategies consider resource constraints:

- Memory optimization for large models
- Batch size reduction for constrained environments
- Progressive loading for multimodal models
- Shared tensor optimization for related models
- Browser-specific resource settings

### 5. Performance Tracking and Analysis

The system includes comprehensive monitoring and analysis:

- Success rate tracking by strategy, browser, and model type
- Execution time measurement for performance optimization
- Historical trend analysis for strategy effectiveness
- Statistical analysis to identify optimal strategies
- Dashboard visualization for recovery metrics

## Usage

### Basic Recovery Usage

```python
from distributed_testing.browser_recovery_strategies import recover_browser

# Recover from a browser failure
async def handle_error(bridge, error):
    success = await recover_browser(bridge, error, {
        "browser": "firefox",
        "model": "whisper-tiny",
        "platform": "webgpu"
    })
    
    if success:
        print("Recovery successful")
    else:
        print("Recovery failed")
```

### Direct Strategy Usage

For more control, you can use the ProgressiveRecoveryManager directly:

```python
from distributed_testing.browser_recovery_strategies import (
    ProgressiveRecoveryManager, BrowserType, ModelType, RecoveryLevel,
    categorize_browser_failure
)

# Create recovery manager
recovery_manager = ProgressiveRecoveryManager()

# Categorize a failure
failure_info = categorize_browser_failure(error, context)

# Execute progressive recovery from a specific level
success = await recovery_manager.execute_progressive_recovery(
    bridge,
    BrowserType.FIREFOX,
    ModelType.AUDIO,
    failure_info,
    start_level=RecoveryLevel.MODERATE  # Skip simple retries
)

# Get performance statistics
stats = recovery_manager.get_strategy_stats()
```

### Integration with Circuit Breaker

This example shows how to integrate with the existing circuit breaker pattern:

```python
from ipfs_accelerate_selenium_bridge import (
    BrowserAutomationBridge, CircuitBreaker, 
    CircuitState, CircuitOpenError
)
from distributed_testing.browser_recovery_strategies import recover_browser

async def run_with_fault_tolerance(model_name, browser_name):
    bridge = BrowserAutomationBridge(
        platform="webgpu",
        browser_name=browser_name,
        model_type=model_name
    )
    
    circuit = CircuitBreaker(f"browser_{browser_name}")
    
    try:
        # Try operation with circuit breaker protection
        result = circuit.execute(
            lambda: bridge.run_test(model_name, "test input")
        )
        return result
    except CircuitOpenError:
        # Circuit is open, cannot retry
        return {"error": "Circuit is open"}
    except Exception as e:
        # Try to recover
        recovered = await recover_browser(bridge, e, {
            "browser": browser_name,
            "model": model_name
        })
        
        if recovered:
            # Retry operation after recovery
            return bridge.run_test(model_name, "test input")
        else:
            # Could not recover
            return {"error": "Recovery failed"}
```
