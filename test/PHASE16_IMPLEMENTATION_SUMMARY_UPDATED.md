| Model Family | CPU | CUDA | ROCm (AMD) | MPS (Apple) | OpenVINO | WebNN | WebGPU |
|--------------|-----|------|------------|-------------|----------|-------|--------|
| Embedding (BERT) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Vision (ViT, DETR) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

This represents a significant improvement from the beginning of Phase 16, where compatibility was primarily limited to CPU and CUDA platforms. All mock implementations have been replaced with real implementations, and the coverage has been extended to include WebNN and WebGPU platforms where feasible. Recent work on test generator fixes has enabled stable test generation for all 13 key model classes across all hardware platforms.

### Comprehensive HuggingFace Model Coverage
