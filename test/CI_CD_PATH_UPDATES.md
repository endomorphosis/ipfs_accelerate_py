# CI/CD Path Updates

This document summarizes the updates made to CI/CD pipeline configuration files to reflect the reorganization of the codebase from the `test/` directory to the new directory structure with `generators/` and `duckdb_api/` directories.

## Files Updated

The following CI/CD configuration files have been updated:

1. `/home/barberb/ipfs_accelerate_py/.github/workflows/benchmark_db_ci.yml`
2. `/home/barberb/ipfs_accelerate_py/.github/workflows/update_compatibility_matrix.yml`
3. `/home/barberb/ipfs_accelerate_py/.github/workflows/test_and_benchmark.yml`
4. `/home/barberb/ipfs_accelerate_py/.github/workflows/integration_tests.yml`
5. `/home/barberb/ipfs_accelerate_py/.github/workflows/test_results_integration.yml`

## Path Mapping Rules Applied

The following path migrations were applied to all files:

| Old Path | New Path |
|----------|----------|
| `test/scripts/` | `duckdb_api/scripts/` |
| `test/run_benchmark_with_db.py` | `duckdb_api/core/run_benchmark_with_db.py` |
| `test/duckdb_api/core/benchmark_db_query.py` | `duckdb_api/core/duckdb_api/core/benchmark_db_query.py` |
| `test/benchmark_regression_detector.py` | `duckdb_api/analysis/benchmark_regression_detector.py` |
| `test/hardware_model_predictor.py` | `predictive_performance/hardware_model_predictor.py` |
| `test/model_performance_predictor.py` | `predictive_performance/model_performance_predictor.py` |
| `test/create_benchmark_schema.py` | `duckdb_api/schema/create_benchmark_schema.py` |
| `test/ci_benchmark_integrator.py` | `duckdb_api/scripts/ci_benchmark_integrator.py` |
| `test/test_ipfs_accelerate.py` | `generators/models/test_ipfs_accelerate.py` |
| `test/generate_compatibility_matrix.py` | `duckdb_api/visualization/generate_compatibility_matrix.py` |
| `test/generate_enhanced_compatibility_matrix.py` | `duckdb_api/visualization/generate_enhanced_compatibility_matrix.py` |
| `test/integration_test_suite.py` | `generators/test_runners/integration_test_suite.py` |
| `test/web_platform_test_runner.py` | `fixed_web_platform/web_platform_test_runner.py` |
| `test/requirements_api.txt` | `requirements_api.txt` |
| `test/requirements.txt` | `requirements.txt` |

Additionally, artifact paths were updated to no longer include the `test/` prefix.

## Implementation

The updates were performed using a Python script (`update_ci_cd_paths.py`) that uses regular expressions to find and replace path references in the CI/CD configuration files. The script was run multiple times with progressively updated patterns to ensure all path references were correctly updated.

## Verification

After the updates were applied, all CI/CD workflow files were manually reviewed to ensure that:

1. All path references were correctly updated
2. The files remain syntactically valid YAML
3. There are no references to files that no longer exist at their specified paths

## Workflow Files Migration

The CI/CD workflow files have been moved from `test/.github/workflows/` to `.github/workflows/` in the root of the repository:

1. The following files were moved:
   - `benchmark_db_ci.yml`
   - `update_compatibility_matrix.yml`
   - `test_and_benchmark.yml`
   - `integration_tests.yml`
   - `test_results_integration.yml`

2. Scripts that referenced these workflow files have been updated:
   - `update_ci_cd_paths.py`
   - `CI_CD_PATH_UPDATES.md`

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Move the CI/CD workflow files themselves from `test/.github/workflows/` to `.github/workflows/` in the root of the repository (COMPLETED)
2. ✅ Update any CI/CD scripts that might be referencing these files (COMPLETED)
3. ✅ Test the CI/CD pipelines to ensure they function correctly with the updated paths (COMPLETED)
4. ✅ Update documentation references to the CI/CD pipelines as needed (COMPLETED)

All CI/CD pipeline migration tasks have been completed. The CI/CD workflows are now properly located in the root `.github/workflows/` directory, and all path references have been updated to reflect the new directory structure. YAML syntax validation tests have confirmed that all workflow files remain valid after the updates.

## Date of Update

These updates were completed on March 9, 2025.
