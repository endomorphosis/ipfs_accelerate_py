# API Implementation Progress Summary

## Current Status (March 1, 2025)

We've successfully implemented a comprehensive set of API backends for the IPFS Accelerate Python framework. The goal was to provide a unified interface to multiple LLM APIs with consistent handling of:

- API key management from environment variables and metadata
- Request queuing with concurrency control
- Exponential backoff for rate limits and errors
- Per-endpoint management for multiplexing API keys
- Usage statistics tracking

   - Maximum queue size configuration (default: 100 requests)
   - Background thread for queue processing
   - Exponential backoff with retry mechanism
   - Request tracking with unique IDs
   - Priority levels support (HIGH/NORMAL/LOW)

3. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**
   - Three-state machine (CLOSED, OPEN, HALF-OPEN)
   - Automatic service outage detection
   - Self-healing capabilities with configurable timeouts
   - Failure threshold configuration
   - Fast-fail for unresponsive services

4. **API Key Multiplexing**
   - Multiple API keys per service
   - Per-endpoint settings
   - Usage balancing
   - Key rotation strategies (round-robin, least-loaded)

5. **Usage Statistics**
   - Request counting
   - Token usage tracking
   - Success/failure metrics
   - Per-model analytics
   - Queue and circuit breaker metrics

6. **Request Batching**
   - Automatic request combining for compatible operations
   - Configurable batch size and timeout
   - Model-specific batching strategies

4. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Created dedicated test suite for queue and backoff functionality
   - Implemented comprehensive Ollama tests with different concurrency settings
   - Added test support for various queue sizes and circuit breaker states

## Conclusion

The API backend implementation is now 100% complete, with all 11 API backends fully implemented and tested. All features are working correctly, including robust queue and backoff systems, circuit breakers, API key multiplexing, and priority queues.

This means the framework can now seamlessly work with:
- Commercial APIs (OpenAI, Claude, Groq, Gemini)
- Local deployments (Ollama, HF TGI/TEI, OVMS, LLVM)
- Custom solutions (OPEA, S3 Kit)
