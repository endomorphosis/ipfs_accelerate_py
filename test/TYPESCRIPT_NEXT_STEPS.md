# IPFS Accelerate TypeScript SDK Next Steps

This document outlines the next steps for the IPFS Accelerate TypeScript SDK implementation, based on the progress made so far.

## Current Status (March 14, 2025)

We have successfully implemented the following components:

1. **Core Tensor Implementation**
   - Base `Tensor` class with TypeScript generics
   - Support for different data types and shapes
   - Basic tensor operations and properties

2. **SharedTensor Implementation**
   - `SharedTensor` class with reference counting
   - `SharedTensorView` for zero-copy tensor slices
   - `TensorSharingManager` for cross-model memory optimization

3. **Tensor Operations**
   - Basic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide, etc.)
   - Matrix operations (matmul, transpose, reshape, etc.)
   - Neural network operations (relu, sigmoid, softmax, etc.)
   - Broadcasting utilities for tensor operations

4. **Example Applications**
   - Tensor matrix operations example
   - Element-wise operations example
   - Neural network operations example
   - Interactive visualization of tensor operations

## Next Steps

### 1. WebGPU Backend Implementation (Target: March 31, 2025)

Our next immediate focus should be implementing the WebGPU backend for hardware acceleration:

- [ ] Create the WebGPU backend class structure
- [ ] Implement tensor creation and transfer to GPU
- [ ] Write WGSL compute shaders for key operations:
  - [ ] Basic arithmetic (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
  - [ ] Matrix multiplication
  - [ ] Activation functions (relu, sigmoid, tanh)
  - [ ] Softmax and normalization
- [ ] Implement efficient buffer management
- [ ] Create a benchmark suite comparing CPU vs WebGPU
- [ ] Add fallback mechanisms for unsupported operations

Key files to start with:
- `src/hardware/webgpu/backend.ts` - Main WebGPU backend implementation
- `src/hardware/webgpu/shaders.ts` - WGSL shader collection
- `src/hardware/webgpu/buffer_manager.ts` - GPU buffer management

### 2. WebNN Integration (Target: April 15, 2025)

After completing the WebGPU backend, we should focus on WebNN integration:

- [ ] Create the WebNN backend class structure
- [ ] Implement graph building for neural networks
- [ ] Create a mapping between our operations and WebNN operations
- [ ] Implement tensor transfer between WebGPU and WebNN
- [ ] Add support for graph-based models
- [ ] Create a benchmark comparing WebGPU vs WebNN

Key files to start with:
- `src/hardware/webnn/backend.ts` - Main WebNN backend implementation
- `src/hardware/webnn/graph_builder.ts` - WebNN graph building utilities
- `src/hardware/webnn/op_mapping.ts` - Operation mapping between our API and WebNN

### 3. Hardware Abstraction Layer (Target: April 30, 2025)

With both backends implemented, we should create a unified hardware abstraction layer:

- [ ] Implement hardware detection for browser capabilities
- [ ] Create automatic backend selection based on operation type
- [ ] Implement fallback mechanisms for unsupported operations
- [ ] Add performance heuristics for optimal backend selection
- [ ] Create a unified API for all backends

Key files to start with:
- `src/hardware/hardware_abstraction.ts` - Main hardware abstraction layer
- `src/hardware/hardware_detection.ts` - Browser capabilities detection
- `src/hardware/backend_selector.ts` - Intelligent backend selection

### 4. Model Implementations (Target: April 30, 2025)

With the hardware backends in place, we can implement specific models:

- [ ] Transformer-based models (BERT, ViT)
- [ ] Basic CNN architectures
- [ ] Model loading utilities
- [ ] Tokenization and preprocessing
- [ ] Pre-trained model weight loading
- [ ] Model execution pipeline

Key files to start with:
- `src/models/transformer.ts` - Base transformer implementation
- `src/models/bert.ts` - BERT model implementation
- `src/models/vit.ts` - Vision Transformer implementation
- `src/models/loader.ts` - Model loading utilities

### 5. React Integration (Target: May 15, 2025)

Create React hooks and components for easy integration:

- [ ] Implement `useModel` hook for model loading
- [ ] Create `useHardwareInfo` hook for hardware capabilities
- [ ] Add `TensorProvider` context for shared tensors
- [ ] Implement streaming inference components
- [ ] Create higher-level model components (text, vision, audio)

Key files to start with:
- `src/react/hooks.ts` - React hooks for models and tensors
- `src/react/components.ts` - React components for tensor visualization and models
- `src/react/context.ts` - Context providers for tensor sharing

### 6. Documentation and Examples (Target: May 31, 2025)

Comprehensive documentation and examples:

- [ ] API documentation for all components
- [ ] Usage guides for different scenarios
- [ ] Performance optimization tips
- [ ] Browser compatibility information
- [ ] Example applications for different use cases
- [ ] Integration with popular frameworks

## Prioritization

Given the current progress, we should prioritize the implementation as follows:

1. **WebGPU Backend**: This is the most critical next step as it enables hardware acceleration
2. **WebNN Integration**: This complements WebGPU for neural network operations
3. **Hardware Abstraction**: This creates a unified API for both backends
4. **Model Implementations**: This provides practical utility for end users
5. **React Integration**: This simplifies integration with web applications
6. **Documentation and Examples**: This ensures usability and adoption

## Resource Allocation

To efficiently implement the remaining components, we should allocate resources as follows:

- **WebGPU Expert**: Focus on WebGPU backend and shader implementations
- **WebNN Expert**: Focus on WebNN integration and graph building
- **TypeScript Developer**: Focus on API design and model implementations
- **Web Developer**: Focus on React integration and examples
- **Technical Writer**: Focus on documentation and guides

## Conclusion

The IPFS Accelerate TypeScript SDK has made significant progress in implementing core tensor operations and shared tensor management. The next phase should focus on hardware acceleration through WebGPU and WebNN backends, followed by model implementations and integration with web frameworks. With the outlined plan, we are on track to complete the implementation by May 31, 2025.
