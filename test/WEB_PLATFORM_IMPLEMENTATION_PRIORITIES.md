## Conclusion

The web platform implementation is on track for completion by August 2025, with several components already completed and others making good progress. The immediate focus is now on completing the Streaming Inference Pipeline by the end of March 2025, followed by accelerating the Unified Framework Integration and Performance Dashboard development in April.

The KV Cache Optimization has been successfully completed, and combined with ultra-low precision (2-bit/3-bit) quantization, we've achieved 87.5% memory reduction with minimal accuracy impact. This enables running 7B parameter models in standard browser environments with just 4GB memory, a significant achievement for web-based AI applications.

We've increased our staffing in mobile optimization and security/QA to ensure robust cross-platform support and production-ready implementation by August 2025.

**Next Review: March 31, 2025** (moved up from April 10 to track Streaming Pipeline completion)
