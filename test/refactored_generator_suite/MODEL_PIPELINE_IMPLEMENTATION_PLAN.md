# Model Pipeline Implementation Plan for Full HuggingFace Coverage

## Overview

This document outlines the plan to implement specialized pipeline templates for all remaining model architecture types in the refactored generator suite. This is a key step toward achieving our goal of full coverage for all 300+ HuggingFace Transformers model classes.

## Current Status

We have successfully implemented specialized pipeline templates for:
- **Text models** (encoder-only, decoder-only, encoder-decoder)
- **Vision models** (image processing, classification, etc.)
- **Vision-Text models** (CLIP, BLIP, etc.)
- **Audio/Speech models** (Whisper, Wav2Vec2, etc.)

## Remaining Implementation Needs

The following architecture types still need specialized pipeline templates:

1. **Multimodal** (broader than vision-text, handling multiple modalities)
   - Examples: FLAVA, LLaVA, ImageBind, IDEFICS, PaliGemma
   - Tasks: multimodal understanding, multiple modality processing

2. **Diffusion Models**
   - Examples: Stable Diffusion, Kandinsky, SAM (Segment Anything)
   - Tasks: image generation, image segmentation, inpainting

3. **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)**
   - Examples: Mixtral, Switch Transformers
   - Tasks: text generation with specialized routing

4. **State-Space Models**
   - Examples: Mamba, RWKV, S4
   - Tasks: efficient sequence modeling

5. **RAG Models**
   - Examples: Retrieval-Augmented Generation models
   - Tasks: retrieval-based generation

## Template Composer Integration

Update `template_composer.py` to:

1. Map architecture types to appropriate pipeline templates:
   ```python
   if arch_type in ["encoder-only", "decoder-only", "encoder-decoder"]:
       pipeline_type = "text"
   elif arch_type in ["vision"]:
       pipeline_type = "image"
   elif arch_type in ["vision-encoder-text-decoder"]:
       pipeline_type = "vision-text"
   elif arch_type in ["speech"]:
       pipeline_type = "audio"
   elif arch_type in ["multimodal"]:
       pipeline_type = "multimodal"
   elif arch_type in ["diffusion"]:
       pipeline_type = "diffusion"
   elif arch_type in ["mixture-of-experts"]:
       pipeline_type = "moe"
   elif arch_type in ["state-space"]:
       pipeline_type = "state-space"
   elif arch_type in ["rag"]:
       pipeline_type = "rag"
   else:
       pipeline_type = "text"  # Default to text
   ```

2. Create and register all new pipeline templates.

## Verification Testing

For each new pipeline template:

1. Create test implementations for representative models:
   - Multimodal: FLAVA, LLaVA
   - Diffusion: Stable Diffusion or SAM
   - MoE: Mixtral
   - State-Space: Mamba or RWKV
   - RAG: RAG model

2. Verify that each implementation contains:
   - Correct pipeline-specific preprocessing
   - Appropriate inference patterns
   - Task-specific result formatting

3. Create a comprehensive verification report.

## Implementation Order and Timeline

Prioritize implementation in this order:

1. **Multimodal Pipeline** (2 days)
   - Most immediately useful and builds on vision-text work
   - Enables support for models like FLAVA, LLaVA, etc.

2. **Diffusion Pipeline** (2 days)
   - High-interest area with popular models like Stable Diffusion
   - Has unique processing needs for images

3. **Mixture-of-Experts Pipeline** (1-2 days)
   - Growing importance with models like Mixtral
   - Relatively straightforward extension of text pipelines

4. **State-Space Pipeline** (1-2 days)
   - Supporting newer efficiency-focused models
   - Special handling for recurrent computation

5. **RAG Pipeline** (1-2 days)
   - Knowledge-grounded generation models
   - Document retrieval integration

**Total estimated time**: 7-10 days

## Success Criteria

The implementation will be considered successful when:

1. All specialized pipeline templates are implemented and integrated
2. Test implementations can be generated for each model architecture type
3. Verification tests confirm correct pipeline-specific functionality
4. Template composer correctly maps architectures to pipelines
5. Documentation is updated to reflect all pipeline options

## Next Steps After Pipeline Implementation

Once all specialized pipeline templates are completed:

1. Update model architecture detection to handle edge cases
2. Implement comprehensive test suite for all architecture types
3. Generate models for all critical priority models
4. Create Matrix report showing full template coverage
5. Begin implementing specialized configurations for high-priority models
