## Accessing the Dashboard

### Web Interface

The compatibility dashboard is available through a web interface:

```bash
# Start the dashboard server
python test/scripts/benchmark_db_api.py --dashboard --port 8000

# Access the dashboard
open http://localhost:8000/dashboard/compatibility
```

### Generating Static Dashboard

You can also generate a static version of the dashboard:

```python
from fixed_web_platform.visualization.dashboards import CompatibilityDashboard

# Create compatibility dashboard
dashboard = CompatibilityDashboard(db_path="./benchmark_db.duckdb")

# Generate static dashboard
dashboard.generate_static(
    output_path="reports/compatibility_dashboard.html",
    include_all_data=True  # Embeds all data for offline use
)
```

### Command-Line Generation

Generate the dashboard using command-line tools:

```bash
# Generate static compatibility dashboard
python test/scripts/benchmark_db_query.py --dashboard compatibility --output reports/compatibility_dashboard.html

# Generate with specific filters
python test/scripts/benchmark_db_query.py --dashboard compatibility --model-types text,vision --hardware-platforms cuda,webgpu --output reports/filtered_compatibility_dashboard.html
```

## Dashboard Features

### Compatibility Matrix

The central feature of the dashboard is the interactive compatibility matrix:

![Compatibility Matrix](https://example.com/compatibility_matrix_screenshot.png)

The matrix shows:
- Model families/types on one axis
- Hardware platforms on the other axis
- Color-coded compatibility status:
  - **Dark Green**: High compatibility (fully optimized)
  - **Light Green**: Medium compatibility
  - **Yellow**: Limited compatibility
  - **Red**: Incompatible
  - **Gray**: Not tested

Hover over any cell to see detailed compatibility information.

### Performance Metrics

For compatible model-hardware combinations, the dashboard shows key performance metrics:

- **Throughput**: Items processed per second
- **Latency**: Processing time in milliseconds
- **Memory Usage**: RAM consumption in MB
- **Power Efficiency**: Items per joule (for mobile/edge)

# Create API client
api = CompatibilityAPI(db_path="./benchmark_db.duckdb")

# Get compatibility for specific model
compatibility = api.get_compatibility(
    model_name="bert-base-uncased",
    hardware_platforms=["cuda", "webgpu", "qualcomm"]
)

# Check if model is compatible with specific hardware
is_compatible = api.is_compatible(
    model_name="bert-base-uncased",
    hardware_platform="webgpu",
    min_compatibility_level="medium"
)

# Get recommended hardware
recommended_hardware = api.get_recommended_hardware(
    model_name="bert-base-uncased",
    criteria={
        "priority": "throughput",  # throughput, latency, memory, power
        "min_compatibility_level": "medium"
    }
)
```

## Best Practices

### Effective Dashboard Usage

1. **Start with the Overview**:
   - Begin with the matrix view to get a high-level understanding
   - Identify areas of high and low compatibility
   - Look for patterns across model families or hardware platforms

2. **Apply Progressive Filtering**:
   - Start with broad filters and gradually narrow down
   - Filter by model type first, then by specific requirements
   - Use multiple filters to find ideal combinations

3. **Compare Similar Models**:
   - Use the comparison view to evaluate similar models
   - Understand trade-offs between model size and performance
   - Identify optimal model-hardware pairings

4. **Track Trends**:
   - Monitor compatibility improvements over time
   - Identify hardware platforms gaining broader support
   - Watch for performance improvements in specific combinations

### Interpreting Compatibility Levels

| Level | Meaning | Indicators | Recommendation |
|-------|---------|------------|----------------|
| High | Fully compatible and optimized | All tests pass, high performance | Recommended for production |
| Medium | Compatible with good performance | Most tests pass, reasonable performance | Suitable for most uses |
| Limited | Basic compatibility with limitations | Some tests fail, lower performance | Use with caution, test thoroughly |
| Incompatible | Not compatible | Tests fail, critical issues | Not recommended |
| Not Tested | Compatibility unknown | No test data available | Test before using |

### Making Hardware Decisions

When using the dashboard to make hardware decisions:

1. **Define Requirements First**:
   - Determine batch size requirements
   - Establish latency constraints
   - Identify memory limitations
   - Consider deployment environment

2. **Prioritize Critical Factors**:
   - For inference services: prioritize throughput and latency
   - For mobile apps: prioritize power efficiency and memory
   - For development: prioritize compatibility and features

3. **Consider Total Cost of Ownership**:
   - Hardware acquisition costs
   - Operating costs (power, cooling)
   - Development effort for optimization
   - Long-term support and updates
