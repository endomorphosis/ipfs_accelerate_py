# Distributed Testing Framework

## Overview

The Distributed Testing Framework for IPFS Accelerate enables efficient execution of tests across multiple worker nodes, providing parallelization, load balancing, and fault tolerance capabilities. This framework is designed to handle large-scale test execution with hardware-aware routing and dynamic resource management.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Coordinator**
   - Central node that manages task distribution and worker coordination
   - Implements a priority-based task queue for optimal test scheduling
   - Provides fault tolerance mechanisms to handle worker failures
   - Supports high availability through leader election and state replication
   - Gathers performance metrics and generates detailed reports
   - Visualizes test execution status for monitoring

2. **Workers**
   - Distributed nodes that execute test tasks
   - Report hardware capabilities for intelligent task assignment
   - Send regular heartbeats to indicate health status
   - Provide real-time progress and result reporting
   - Support recovery from failures through persistent state

3. **Task Queue**
   - Priority-based scheduling for optimal test execution order
   - Supports different task types (model tests, hardware tests, API tests)
   - Implements fairness and starvation prevention mechanisms
   - Enables task preemption for high-priority tests

4. **Monitoring Dashboard**
   - Real-time visualization of test execution status
   - Performance metrics and trend analysis
   - Hardware utilization and failure statistics
   - Test coverage and result reporting

## Implementation Details

### Coordinator Component

The coordinator is implemented in `distributed_testing/coordinator.py` and provides the following functionality:

- **Task Management**: Creation, assignment, tracking, and completion of test tasks
- **Worker Management**: Registration, heartbeat monitoring, and capability tracking
- **High Availability**: Leader election, state replication, and automatic failover
- **Reporting**: Status reports, performance metrics, and visualization

#### Key Classes

- `TestCoordinator`: Main coordinator class
- `Task`: Represents a test task with status tracking
- `Worker`: Represents a worker node with capability information
- `TaskQueue`: Priority queue for scheduling tasks
- `CoordinatorState`: Represents the coordinator's internal state

### Worker Component

Workers connect to the coordinator and execute assigned test tasks:

- Report hardware capabilities during registration
- Send regular heartbeats with status updates
- Execute test tasks and report results
- Support recovery from failures through persistent state

### Communication Protocol

The coordinator and workers communicate using a simple API-based protocol:

1. **Registration**: Workers register with the coordinator, providing capability information
2. **Heartbeat**: Workers send regular heartbeats to indicate health status
3. **Task Assignment**: Coordinator assigns tasks to workers based on capabilities
4. **Status Updates**: Workers report task status updates (running, completed, failed)
5. **Result Reporting**: Workers report test results upon completion
6. **Command Channel**: Coordinator can send commands to workers (stop, restart, update)

## Usage

### Starting the Coordinator

```bash
# Start the coordinator with default settings
python -m distributed_testing.coordinator

# Start the coordinator with custom settings
python -m distributed_testing.coordinator --host 192.168.1.100 --port 5000 --heartbeat-interval 10 --worker-timeout 30
```

### Running Tests in Distributed Mode

To execute tests in distributed mode using the framework, use the `run.py` script with the `--distributed` flag:

```bash
# Run all tests in distributed mode with 4 workers
python run.py --distributed --worker-count 4

# Run model tests in distributed mode
python run.py --test-type model --distributed --worker-count 4

# Run with specific coordinator address
python run.py --distributed --worker-count 4 --coordinator 192.168.1.100:5000
```

## High Availability Mode

The framework supports high availability mode for the coordinator, providing resilience against coordinator failures:

```bash
# Start the coordinator in high availability mode
python -m distributed_testing.coordinator --high-availability
```

In high availability mode, multiple coordinator instances can be started, and they will elect a leader using a Raft-inspired consensus algorithm. If the leader fails, a new leader will be automatically elected, providing uninterrupted test execution.

## Hardware-Aware Test Routing

The framework implements hardware-aware test routing, matching test requirements with worker capabilities:

- Tests specify hardware and software requirements
- Workers report available capabilities
- Coordinator matches tests to workers based on requirements
- Optimization for utilizing specific hardware capabilities (GPU, WebGPU, WebNN, etc.)

## Performance Visualization

The coordinator provides performance visualization through the `generate_visualization` method:

```python
# Generate a visualization of the coordinator state
coordinator.generate_visualization('coordinator_status.png')
```

This generates a visualization with:

- Task status distribution
- Worker status distribution
- Task duration histogram
- Worker performance comparison
- Overall statistics

## Advanced Features

### Dynamic Resource Management

The framework supports dynamic resource management:

- Automatic scaling based on test load
- Cloud integration for provisioning additional workers
- Resource optimization for efficient test execution
- Cost-aware scheduling for cloud resources

### Intelligent Test Scheduling

The framework implements intelligent test scheduling through:

- Priority-based task queue
- Test dependency resolution
- Optimization for test execution time
- Avoidance of resource contention

### Fault Tolerance

The framework provides fault tolerance through multiple mechanisms:

- Worker failure detection and recovery
- Task reassignment on worker failure
- Persistent state for recovery
- High availability for coordinator

## Integration with CI/CD

The distributed testing framework integrates with CI/CD systems:

- GitHub Actions workflow support (see `.github/workflows/test-framework.yml`)
- Jenkins integration for enterprise environments
- GitLab CI support
- Customizable reporting for CI/CD pipelines

## Monitoring and Alerting

The framework provides monitoring and alerting functionality:

- Real-time status monitoring through the dashboard
- Performance metrics collection and analysis
- Anomaly detection for test execution
- Alerting for critical failures

## Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements for the distributed testing framework:

1. **Enhanced Visualization**: Interactive web-based dashboard with real-time updates
2. **Machine Learning-Based Scheduling**: Predictive performance optimization
3. **Cross-Platform Worker Support**: Expanded support for various platforms
4. **Integration with Test Analytics**: Comprehensive test analytics platform
5. **Mobile Device Testing**: Support for mobile device testing
6. **Edge Computing Integration**: Support for edge computing environments
