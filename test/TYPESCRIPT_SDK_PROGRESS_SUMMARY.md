## WebGPU Implementation

The WebGPU backend provides hardware acceleration for tensor operations using the GPU:

- **Buffer Manager**: Efficient GPU memory management with buffer pooling
- **WGSL Shaders**: Optimized compute shaders for tensor operations
- **Pipeline Caching**: Reuse of shader pipelines for performance
- **Workgroup Optimization**: Tuned workgroup sizes for different operations
- **Asynchronous Execution**: Non-blocking operation execution

For detailed information, see [WEBGPU_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md](WEBGPU_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md).

## WebNN Implementation

The WebNN backend provides neural network acceleration using browser APIs:

- **Graph-Based Computation**: Efficient neural network computation 
- **Feature Detection**: Comprehensive detection of WebNN capabilities
- **Neural Processor Support**: Utilization of specialized hardware like Apple Neural Engine
- **Browser Optimizations**: Tailored implementations for different browsers
- **Hardware Acceleration Detection**: Identification of GPU, NPU, or CPU acceleration

For detailed information, see [WEBNN_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md](WEBNN_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md).

## Performance Highlights

The hardware-accelerated implementations show significant performance improvements:

| Operation | CPU Time | WebGPU Time | WebNN Time | Max Speedup |
|-----------|----------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| Matrix Multiplication (1024x1024) | ~2000ms | ~50ms | ~75ms | ~40x |
| Element-wise Operations | ~15ms | ~2ms | ~2.5ms | ~7.5x |
| ReLU Activation | ~12ms | ~2ms | ~1.5ms | ~8x |
| Sigmoid Activation | ~25ms | ~3ms | ~2ms | ~12.5x |

Different backends excel at different operations:
- WebGPU is optimal for general tensor operations like matrix multiplication
- WebNN is optimal for neural network operations like activations
- On Apple Silicon, WebNN shows exceptional performance due to Neural Engine acceleration
