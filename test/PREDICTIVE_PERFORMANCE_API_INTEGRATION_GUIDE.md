The Python client library provides an easy way to interact with the API:

```python
from test.api_client.predictive_performance_client import (
    PredictivePerformanceClient,
    HardwarePlatform,
    PrecisionType,
    ModelMode
)

# Create client
client = PredictivePerformanceClient(base_url="http://localhost:8080")

# Predict optimal hardware
result = client.predict_hardware(
    model_name="bert-base-uncased",
    batch_size=8,
    available_hardware=[HardwarePlatform.CPU, HardwarePlatform.CUDA],
    predict_performance=True,
    wait=True  # Wait for task completion
)
print(f"Hardware recommendation: {result['result']['primary_recommendation']}")

# Record a measurement
client.record_measurement(
    model_name="bert-base-uncased",
    hardware_platform=HardwarePlatform.CUDA,
    batch_size=8,
    throughput=120.5,
    latency=8.3,
    memory_usage=1024.0,
    wait=True
)

# List recommendations
recommendations = client.list_recommendations(limit=5)
print(f"Found {recommendations['count']} recommendations")
```

The library also provides an asynchronous client for use with asyncio:

```python
import asyncio
from test.api_client.predictive_performance_client import AsyncPredictivePerformanceClient

async def main():
    client = AsyncPredictivePerformanceClient()
    try:
        result = await client.predict_hardware(
            model_name="bert-base-uncased",
            batch_size=8,
            wait=True
        )
        print(result)
    finally:
        await client.close()

asyncio.run(main())
```

## Modifying the Integration

If you need to modify the integration, use the `update_unified_api.py` script:

```bash
# Update the Unified API Server with Predictive Performance API integration
python test/api_server/update_unified_api.py

# Restore from backup
python test/api_server/update_unified_api.py --restore
```

## Database Schema

The DuckDB integration provides tables for:

- Predictions: Store performance predictions for model-hardware pairs
- Measurements: Record actual performance measurements
- Recommendations: Hardware recommendations for models
- Prediction Models: Machine learning models for predicting performance
- Feedback: User feedback on recommendations
- Feature Importance: Feature importance scores for ML models

## Configuration

The Predictive Performance API can be configured with environment variables or command-line arguments:

- `PREDICTIVE_PERFORMANCE_DB`: Path to DuckDB database file
- `BENCHMARK_DIR`: Path to benchmark results directory
- `BENCHMARK_DB`: Path to benchmark database

Command-line arguments:
- `--host`: Host to bind server (default: 127.0.0.1)
- `--port`: Port to bind server (default: 8500)
- `--db`: Path to DuckDB database
- `--benchmark-dir`: Path to benchmark results directory
- `--benchmark-db`: Path to benchmark database

## Security

The Unified API Server applies its API key validation to database operations. To authenticate, include the `X-API-Key` header with your requests.

## Troubleshooting

Common issues:

1. **Connection refused**: Ensure the servers are running on the expected ports
2. **Missing dependencies**: Install required packages with `pip install fastapi uvicorn websockets requests duckdb`
3. **Database errors**: Check the database path and ensure it exists with proper permissions
4. **Task timeout**: Increase the timeout value for long-running operations

## Examples

### Batch Size Performance Analysis

```python
# Analyze performance across batch sizes
client = PredictivePerformanceClient()
batch_sizes = [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32]
results = {}

for batch in batch_sizes:
    result = client.predict_performance(
        model_name="bert-base-uncased",
        hardware=HardwarePlatform.CUDA,
        batch_size=batch,
        wait=True
    )
    if "result" in result and "predictions" in result["result"]:
        results[batch] = result["result"]["predictions"]["cuda"]["throughput"]

# Print results
for batch, throughput in results.items():
    print(f"Batch size {batch}: {throughput:.2f} samples/sec")
```

### Finding the Best Hardware for a Model

```python
# Find the best hardware for a model
client = PredictivePerformanceClient()
result = client.predict_hardware(
    model_name="bert-base-uncased",
    available_hardware=[
        HardwarePlatform.CPU,
        HardwarePlatform.CUDA,
        HardwarePlatform.ROCM,
        HardwarePlatform.WEBGPU
    ],
    predict_performance=True,
    wait=True
)

# Print recommendations
if "result" in result:
    primary = result["result"]["primary_recommendation"]
    print(f"Primary recommendation: {primary}")
    
    alternatives = result["result"].get("alternative_recommendations", [])
    if alternatives:
        print("Alternative recommendations:")
        for alt in alternatives:
            print(f"- {alt}")
    
    if "performance" in result["result"]:
        perf = result["result"]["performance"]
        print(f"Predicted performance on {primary}:")
        print(f"- Throughput: {perf.get('throughput', 'N/A')} samples/sec")
        print(f"- Latency: {perf.get('latency', 'N/A')} ms")
        print(f"- Memory usage: {perf.get('memory_usage', 'N/A')} MB")
```

## Integration with Other Components

The Predictive Performance API is designed to integrate with other components in the IPFS Accelerate ecosystem:

### Integration with Benchmark API

You can automatically feed benchmark results into the Predictive Performance system:

```python
from test.api_client.predictive_performance_client import PredictivePerformanceClient
from test.refactored_benchmark_suite.api_client import BenchmarkApiClient

# Create clients
benchmark_client = BenchmarkApiClient(base_url="http://localhost:8080")
predictive_client = PredictivePerformanceClient(base_url="http://localhost:8080")

# Run a benchmark
benchmark_result = benchmark_client.run_benchmark(
    model_name="bert-base-uncased",
    hardware="cuda",
    batch_size=8,
    wait=True
)

# Record the benchmark result in the Predictive Performance system
if benchmark_result["status"] == "completed":
    metrics = benchmark_result["result"]["metrics"]
    predictive_client.record_measurement(
        model_name="bert-base-uncased",
        hardware_platform="cuda",
        batch_size=8,
        throughput=metrics["throughput"],
        latency=metrics["latency"],
        memory_usage=metrics["memory_usage"],
        source="benchmark",
        wait=True
    )
```

### Integration with Test API

You can use hardware recommendations when running tests:

```python
from test.api_client.predictive_performance_client import PredictivePerformanceClient
from test.refactored_test_suite.api.api_client import ApiClient

# Create clients
test_client = ApiClient(base_url="http://localhost:8080")
predictive_client = PredictivePerformanceClient(base_url="http://localhost:8080")

# Get hardware recommendation
hw_result = predictive_client.predict_hardware(
    model_name="bert-base-uncased",
    wait=True
)

if "result" in hw_result:
    recommended_hw = hw_result["result"]["primary_recommendation"]
    
    # Run test on recommended hardware
    test_response = test_client.run_test(
        model_name="bert-base-uncased",
        hardware=recommended_hw
    )
```

### Cross-Component Database Queries

Through the Unified API Server, you can perform cross-component queries:

```python
import requests

# Query the unified database view for a specific model
response = requests.get(
    "http://localhost:8080/api/db/model/bert-base-uncased",
    headers={"X-API-Key": "your-api-key"}
)

if response.status_code == 200:
    data = response.json()
    
    # Access data from different components
    test_data = data["recent_test_runs"]
    benchmark_data = data["recent_benchmark_runs"]
    prediction_data = data["recent_predictions"]
    
    # Use the combined data for analysis
    print(f"Test success rate: {data['overview']['test_success_rate']:.2f}")
    print(f"Benchmark performance: {benchmark_data[0]['throughput'] if benchmark_data else 'N/A'}")
    print(f"Predicted performance: {prediction_data[0]['throughput'] if prediction_data else 'N/A'}")
```
