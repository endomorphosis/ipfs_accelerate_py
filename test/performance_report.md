## Multi-Tier Model Selection Strategy

We've implemented a systematic model selection strategy with multiple fallbacks:

1. **Size-Prioritized Model Selection**:
   - Try smallest open-access model first (60-250MB)
   - Fall back to progressively larger alternatives in priority order
   - Check for cached models in the Hugging Face cache
   - Create local test model as final fallback

2. **Model Validation**:
   - Verify model exists before attempting to load
   - Check model compatibility with task requirements
   - Validate model size against available memory
   - Confirm model architecture compatibility

3. **Authentication Handling**:
   - Try unauthenticated access to open models first
   - Fall back to local test models when authentication is required
   - Implement simulated real implementations for token-gated models
   - Provide clear messaging about authentication status

4. **Local Test Model Generation**:
   - Create task-appropriate architectures for each model type
   - Generate realistic dimensions and parameters
   - Support all operations needed for testing
   - Ensure consistent behavior across all hardware backends

## Conclusion
