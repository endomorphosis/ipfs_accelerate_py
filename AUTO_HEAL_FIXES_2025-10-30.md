# Auto-Heal System Fixes - October 30, 2025

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Auto-Heal Workflow Triggering on Push Events âœ… FIXED

**Problem**: The auto-heal workflow was being triggered by `push` events in addition to `workflow_run` events. When triggered by push, it would fail because it expected `github.event.workflow_run` data which doesn't exist in push events.

**Root Cause**: The workflow configuration file was being modified as part of development work. When this happens, GitHub Actions re-evaluates the workflow and can trigger it even though no workflow_run event has occurred. The issue is that the conditional check `if: ${{ github.event.workflow_run.conclusion == 'failure' }}` tries to access `github.event.workflow_run` which is `null` when the workflow is triggered by other means, causing the job to be skipped but still show as "failed" in the UI.

**Solution**: Added a conditional check to only run the workflow when `github.event_name == 'workflow_run'`:

```yaml
jobs:
  detect-and-heal:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # Only trigger if this is a workflow_run event AND the workflow failed
    if: ${{ (github.event_name == 'workflow_run' && github.event.workflow_run.conclusion == 'failure') || github.event_name == 'workflow_dispatch' }}
```

**Impact**: The auto-heal workflow will now only run when:
- A monitored workflow completes with a failure (workflow_run event)
- Manual dispatch is triggered for testing

### 2. Added Manual Testing Capability âœ… ADDED

**Problem**: Testing the auto-heal workflow required actual workflow failures, making it difficult to test and debug.

**Solution**: Added `workflow_dispatch` trigger with optional `run_id` parameter:

```yaml
on:
  workflow_run:
    workflows:
      - "AMD64 CI/CD Pipeline"
      - "ARM64 CI/CD Pipeline"
      - "Multi-Architecture CI/CD Pipeline"
      - "Package Installation Test"
      - "Test Auto-Heal System"
    types:
      - completed
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      run_id:
        description: 'Workflow run ID to analyze (for testing)'
        required: false
        type: string
```

**Updated Environment Variables**: Made environment variables work for both event types:

```yaml
env:
  WORKFLOW_RUN_ID: ${{ github.event.workflow_run.id || github.event.inputs.run_id }}
  WORKFLOW_NAME: ${{ github.event.workflow_run.name || 'Manual Test' }}
  WORKFLOW_URL: ${{ github.event.workflow_run.html_url || format('https://github.com/{0}/actions/runs/{1}', github.repository, github.event.inputs.run_id) }}
```

**Impact**: Maintainers can now:
- Manually trigger auto-heal on any failed workflow run
- Test the auto-heal system without creating fake failures
- Debug issues more easily

## Testing Instructions

### Test with Manual Dispatch

1. Go to Actions tab in GitHub
2. Select "Auto-Heal Workflow Failures" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Enter a run ID from a failed workflow (e.g., `18926851113`)
5. Watch the auto-heal workflow analyze and create issues/PRs

### Test with Simulated Failure

1. Go to Actions tab in GitHub
2. Select "Test Auto-Heal System" workflow
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Choose a failure type (e.g., `resource_error`)
5. Wait for the test workflow to fail
6. The auto-heal workflow should automatically trigger
7. Check for new issues with `auto-heal` label

## Known Issues Found

### AMD64 CI Workflow - Disk Space Failure

**Run ID**: 18926851113
**Error**: `no space left on device` during Docker build
**Category**: RESOURCE
**Status**: Identified by auto-heal system

**Error Logs**:
```
#16 ERROR: write /blobs/sha256/...: no space left on device
ERROR: failed to build: failed to solve: failed to copy to tar: rpc error: code = Unknown desc = io: read/write on closed pipe
```

**Recommended Actions**:
1. Add Docker layer cleanup steps
2. Use larger GitHub runners (ubuntu-latest-large)
3. Implement multi-stage Docker builds to reduce layer sizes
4. Add cleanup of build caches before Docker build

## Files Modified

- `.github/workflows/auto-heal-failures.yml`
  - Added event_name check
  - Added workflow_dispatch trigger
  - Updated environment variables for both event types

## Commits

1. Fix auto-heal workflow trigger to only run on workflow_run events
2. Add workflow_dispatch trigger to auto-heal for testing
3. Add comprehensive documentation for auto-heal system fixes

_(See git log for commit SHAs)_

## Security Considerations

âœ… No security issues introduced:
- Still respects all permissions
- Only runs on authorized events
- No new secrets or credentials needed
- Maintains existing branch protection

## Performance Impact

âœ… Positive impact:
- Reduced spurious workflow runs (no more push event failures)
- Faster debugging with manual dispatch
- No performance degradation

## Backward Compatibility

âœ… Fully backward compatible:
- Existing workflow_run triggers still work
- No breaking changes to scripts
- Existing configuration still valid
- Manual dispatch is optional
