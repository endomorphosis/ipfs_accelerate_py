# Glob patterns for files that are temporarily allowed to reference asyncio.
#
# The intent is for this file to shrink over time until it is empty.
#
# Examples:
# ipfs_accelerate_py/legacy/**
# test/**

# Current policy: allow tests to continue to use asyncio while core code migrates.
# Tighten this once we finish the migration.

test/**

# Tooling that intentionally references asyncio as text (migration/audit helpers)
