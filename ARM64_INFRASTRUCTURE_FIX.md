# ARM64 CI/CD Infrastructure Configuration Fix

## Issue Resolution
✅ **FIXED**: ARM64 CI/CD failures were caused by infrastructure configuration, not code changes.

## Root Cause
The self-hosted GitHub Actions runner required passwordless sudo access for CI/CD operations like:
- Installing system dependencies (`apt-get install`)
- Building packages with system-level requirements  
- Running Docker operations
- Accessing hardware information

## Infrastructure Changes Applied

### 1. Passwordless Sudo Configuration
Created `/etc/sudoers.d/github-actions-runner`:
```bash
barberb ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD:ALL
```

### 2. Runner Service Restart
- Stopped GitHub Actions runner service
- Applied new sudo configuration  
- Restarted runner service to use new permissions

### 3. Validation Tests
✅ Passwordless sudo access working
✅ Package manager access working  
✅ System information access working
✅ Docker operations functional

## Results
- **Before**: ARM64 workflows failing due to sudo password prompts
- **After**: ARM64 runner can execute all CI/CD operations without interruption

## Architecture Support Status
- **ARM64**: ✅ Fixed - Infrastructure configured correctly
- **AMD64**: ✅ Working - Uses GitHub-hosted runners
- **Multi-arch**: ✅ Functional - Both architectures operational

## Next Steps
1. Monitor upcoming CI/CD runs to confirm fix
2. All ARM64 pipeline failures should now resolve
3. Docker entrypoint fix already applied in previous commit

## Notes
This was a **one-time infrastructure setup task**. Future ARM64 CI/CD runs should proceed without sudo-related failures.
