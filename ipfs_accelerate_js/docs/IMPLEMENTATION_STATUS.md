## Technical Details

### Interface Design

We've implemented a comprehensive set of interfaces with proper TypeScript generics:

- `IBackend`: Interface for hardware backends
- `IModel<TInput, TOutput>`: Interface for models with generic input/output types
- `ITensor`: Interface for tensor operations
- `IHardwareAbstraction`: Interface for hardware abstraction
- `IResourcePool`: Interface for resource management

### Hardware Abstraction

The hardware abstraction layer provides a unified interface to the various hardware backends:

- Automatic detection of available hardware
- Optimal backend selection based on model type and browser
- Browser-specific optimizations
- Fallback mechanisms for unavailable hardware

### Resource Pool

A key component for efficient resource management:

- Manages limited browser resources like WebGPU devices and WebNN contexts
- Provides a queue system for resource requests
- Automatic cleanup of idle resources
- Priority-based allocation for critical resources

### Models

We've implemented a basic model system with BERT as the first example:

- Generic model interface with type-safe inputs and outputs
- Hardware-aware model execution
- Simple tokenization for text models

## Conclusion

The core infrastructure of the IPFS Accelerate JavaScript SDK is now in place, providing a solid foundation for adding more models and features. The implementation follows best practices for TypeScript libraries and ensures compatibility with modern browsers.
