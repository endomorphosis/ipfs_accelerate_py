Multi-Model Execution Support for the Predictive Performance System.

This module provides functionality to predict performance metrics for scenarios
where multiple models are executed concurrently on the same hardware. It accounts
for resource contention, parallel execution benefits, && memory sharing
opportunities between models.

Key features:
1. Resource contention modeling for CPU, GPU, && memory
2. Cross-model tensor sharing efficiency prediction
3. Parallel execution scheduling simulation
4. Memory optimization modeling
5. Power usage prediction for multi-model workloads
6. Integration with Web Resource Pool for browser-based execution
