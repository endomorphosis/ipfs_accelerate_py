# GitHub Actions Runner Installation Summary

## What I've Created

I've set up a complete GitHub Actions runner installation system for your backup machine with the following components:

### 1. Main Setup Script: `setup_github_actions_runner.sh`
- **Full automated installation** of GitHub Actions runner
- **Security-focused**: Creates dedicated `actions-runner` user
- **Production-ready**: Installs as systemd service with auto-start
- **Architecture detection**: Automatically detects x64/arm64
- **Project integration**: Clones repo and installs dependencies
- **Error handling**: Comprehensive checks and validations

### 2. Interactive Setup Script: `setup_runner_interactive.sh`
- **User-friendly interface** with guided setup
- **Token collection**: Securely prompts for GitHub token
- **Status checking**: Detects existing runners
- **Visual feedback**: Colored output and progress indicators

### 3. Comprehensive Guide: `GITHUB_ACTIONS_RUNNER_SETUP.md`
- **Step-by-step instructions** for manual setup
- **Troubleshooting section** for common issues
- **Management commands** for runner maintenance
- **Workflow examples** for using the backup runner
- **Security considerations** and best practices

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Interactive Setup (Recommended)
```bash
./setup_runner_interactive.sh
```

### Option 2: Direct Setup
```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN='your_github_token_here'
./setup_github_actions_runner.sh
```

## Runner Configuration

Your backup runner will be configured as:
- **Name**: `fent-reactor-backup-runner`
- **Labels**: `linux,x64,self-hosted,backup-runner`
- **Repository**: `endomorphosis/ipfs_accelerate_py`
- **Service**: Auto-starts on boot

## Key Features

### Security
- ✅ Dedicated user account (`actions-runner`)
- ✅ Restricted file permissions
- ✅ Secure token handling
- ✅ Service isolation

### Automation
- ✅ Systemd service integration
- ✅ Automatic startup on boot
- ✅ Log rotation and management
- ✅ Dependency installation

### Monitoring
- ✅ Service status checking
- ✅ GitHub registration verification
- ✅ Comprehensive logging
- ✅ Health checks

### Maintenance
- ✅ Easy start/stop/restart
- ✅ Log viewing commands
- ✅ Update procedures
- ✅ Uninstall option

## GitHub Token Requirements

To run the setup, you need a GitHub Personal Access Token with these permissions:
- `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
- `admin:repo_hook` (Admin access to repository hooks)

Create one at: https://github.com/settings/tokens

## Next Steps

1. **Run the setup script** with your GitHub token
2. **Verify installation** on GitHub at: https://github.com/endomorphosis/ipfs_accelerate_py/settings/actions/runners
3. **Test the runner** by triggering a workflow
4. **Monitor logs** for any issues

## File Locations

- **Scripts**: `/home/barberb/ipfs_accelerate_py/setup_*runner*.sh`
- **Documentation**: `/home/barberb/ipfs_accelerate_py/GITHUB_ACTIONS_RUNNER_SETUP.md`
- **Runner Directory**: `/home/actions-runner/actions-runner/` (after installation)
- **Project Directory**: `/home/actions-runner/ipfs_accelerate_py/` (after installation)

## Management Commands

After installation:

```bash
# Check status
./setup_github_actions_runner.sh --status

# View logs
sudo journalctl -u actions.runner.* -f

# Restart runner
sudo systemctl restart actions.runner.*

# Uninstall
GITHUB_TOKEN='your_token' ./setup_github_actions_runner.sh --uninstall
```

## Workflow Usage

Target your backup runner in GitHub Actions workflows:

```yaml
jobs:
  backup-job:
    runs-on: [self-hosted, linux, backup-runner]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Run tests
        run: python -m pytest
```

## Integration with Existing Runners

This backup runner is designed to complement your existing GitHub Actions infrastructure:

- **Different labels**: Use `backup-runner` label to specifically target this machine
- **Load balancing**: GitHub will distribute jobs across available runners
- **Fallback capability**: If your primary runner is unavailable, workflows can run on this backup
- **Resource isolation**: Runs as separate user with own dependencies

## Security Considerations

- The runner has sudo access (required for many CI operations)
- Consider running on a dedicated VM or container for additional isolation
- Regularly update the runner software
- Monitor runner activity through GitHub's web interface
- Rotate GitHub tokens periodically
