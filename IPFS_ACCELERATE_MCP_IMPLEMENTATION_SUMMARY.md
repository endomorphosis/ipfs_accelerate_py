# IPFS Accelerate MCP Implementation Summary

This document summarizes the implementation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration for IPFS Accelerate.

## Overview

The IPFS Accelerate MCP integration provides a robust interface for Large Language Models (LLMs) to interact with IPFS and hardware acceleration capabilities. The implementation follows a modular design and includes both real implementations (when dependencies are available) and fallback mock implementations (for development and testing).

## Architecture

The MCP integration is organized into the following components:

### Core Components

1. **Server**: The main MCP server implementation
   - `mcp/server.py`: Core server implementation with lifespan handlers
   - `mcp/mock_mcp.py`: Mock MCP server implementation for when FastMCP is not available

2. **Tools**: Individual tools exposed through the MCP API
   - `mcp/tools/ipfs_files.py`: IPFS file operation tools (add, cat, ls, etc.)
   - `mcp/tools/ipfs_network.py`: IPFS network operation tools (swarm, dht, etc.)
   - `mcp/tools/acceleration.py`: Model acceleration tools
   - `mcp/tools/mock_ipfs.py`: Mock IPFS client implementation for testing

3. **Types**: Shared type definitions and context objects
   - `mcp/types.py`: Definitions for IPFS Accelerate context and other shared types

4. **Runner**: Entry point for starting the MCP server
   - `run_mcp.py`: Script for starting the MCP server with configuration options

### Supporting Components

1. **Examples**: Example usage of the MCP integration
   - `examples/mcp_integration_example.py`: Example Python client for MCP server

2. **Tests**: Unit tests for the MCP integration
   - `test/test_mcp_integration.py`: Tests for MCP server and tools

3. **Documentation**: Documentation files
   - `mcp/README.md`: General documentation for the MCP integration
   - `mcp/requirements-mcp.txt`: List of required dependencies

## Implementation Details

### Dependency Handling

The implementation gracefully handles dependencies that may or may not be available:

- **FastMCP**: Falls back to a mock implementation if the real FastMCP package is not available
- **ipfs-kit-py**: Falls back to a mock IPFS client if ipfs-kit-py is not available

This approach ensures that development and basic testing can proceed even without all dependencies installed.

### Tool Organization

Tools are organized by functionality:

- **File Operations**: Adding, retrieving, listing, and pinning IPFS content
- **Network Operations**: Working with IPFS swarm, DHT, and PubSub
- **Acceleration**: Hardware acceleration of AI models

Each tool module provides a registration function that registers all tools in the module with the MCP server.

### Context Sharing

Shared state is maintained through the IPFSAccelerateContext object:

- **IPFS Client**: Shared IPFS client instance
- **Hardware Info**: Information about available hardware for acceleration
- **Model Registry**: Registry of accelerated models

The context is created during server startup and passed to all tools.

## Usage

### Starting the Server

```bash
# Basic usage
python run_mcp.py

# With debug logging
python run_mcp.py --debug

# Using SSE transport
python run_mcp.py --transport sse --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

### Using from Claude

Claude can interact with the MCP server using the `use_mcp_tool` capability:

```
<use_mcp_tool>
<server_name>direct-ipfs-kit-mcp</server_name>
<tool_name>ipfs_add_file</tool_name>
<arguments>
{
  "path": "/path/to/file.txt"
}
</arguments>
</use_mcp_tool>
```

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Tool Implementations**: Some tool functions need implementation details specific to IPFS Accelerate
2. **Integration with WebNN/WebGPU**: Connect with existing WebNN and WebGPU functionality
3. **Comprehensive Testing**: Expand test coverage for all tools and edge cases
4. **Documentation**: Create detailed documentation for LLM usage
5. **Packaging**: Package the MCP integration for distribution

## Conclusion

The IPFS Accelerate MCP integration provides a flexible and robust interface for LLMs to interact with IPFS and hardware acceleration functionality. The modular design and fallback mock implementations ensure that development and testing can proceed smoothly, while the comprehensive tool set exposes the full power of IPFS Accelerate to LLMs.
