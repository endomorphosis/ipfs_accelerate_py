# IPFS Accelerate MCP Server Testing Summary

This document provides a summary of the tests performed on the IPFS Accelerate MCP server implementation.

## Server Deployment

We created a restart script (`restart_mcp_server.sh`) that successfully:

1. Stops any running MCP server on the specified port
2. Creates a new Python script with all IPFS tools registered
3. Starts the MCP server with the registered tools
4. Confirms the server is running properly

## Tools Registration

The following IPFS tools were successfully registered with the MCP server:

- **ipfs_add_file**: Add a file to IPFS
- **ipfs_cat**: Read the contents of a file from IPFS
- **ipfs_get_file**: Download a file from IPFS
- **ipfs_files_write**: Write to a file in IPFS MFS
- **ipfs_files_read**: Read from a file in IPFS MFS
- **ipfs_files_ls**: List files and directories in IPFS MFS
- **ipfs_pin_add**: Pin content in IPFS
- **ipfs_pin_rm**: Unpin content in IPFS
- **ipfs_pin_ls**: List pinned content in IPFS
- **ipfs_node_info**: Get information about the IPFS node

The server also registered the following resources:

- **ipfs_nodes**: Information about connected IPFS nodes
- **ipfs_files**: Information about files stored in IPFS
- **ipfs_pins**: Information about pinned content in IPFS

## Direct HTTP Testing

We created a test script (`test_ipfs_mcp.py`) that verifies all IPFS tools work correctly through direct HTTP requests to the server. All tests passed successfully, demonstrating that:

1. Files can be added to IPFS and retrieved by CID
2. Content can be pinned and unpinned
3. The Mutable File System (MFS) operations work as expected
4. Server resources can be accessed successfully

## MCP Client Interface Testing

We attempted to test the tools through Claude's MCP client interface, but encountered connection issues. The server is configured in the MCP settings file (`cline_mcp_settings.json`) as "ipfs-accelerate-mcp", but the connection appears to be inactive.

```json
"ipfs-accelerate-mcp": {
  "disabled": false,
  "timeout": 60,
  "url": "http://localhost:8002/sse",
  "transportType": "sse"
}
```

### Manual Testing Instructions

For manual testing through the MCP client interface, once the connection issues are resolved:

1. Use the MCP tool 'ipfs_node_info':
   ```
   use_mcp_tool with server_name='ipfs-accelerate-mcp', tool_name='ipfs_node_info', arguments={}
   ```

2. Use the MCP tool 'ipfs_files_write':
   ```
   use_mcp_tool with server_name='ipfs-accelerate-mcp', tool_name='ipfs_files_write', 
   arguments={'path': '/claude-test.txt', 'content': 'Hello from Claude!'}
   ```

3. Use the MCP tool 'ipfs_files_read':
   ```
   use_mcp_tool with server_name='ipfs-accelerate-mcp', tool_name='ipfs_files_read', 
   arguments={'path': '/claude-test.txt'}
   ```

4. Use the MCP tool 'ipfs_files_ls':
   ```
   use_mcp_tool with server_name='ipfs-accelerate-mcp', tool_name='ipfs_files_ls', 
   arguments={'path': '/'}
   ```

## Conclusion

1. **Server Functionality**: ✅ The MCP server is running correctly, and all IPFS tools are properly registered.
2. **Direct HTTP Access**: ✅ The IPFS tools can be successfully accessed via direct HTTP calls.
3. **MCP Client Interface**: ❌ There appear to be connection issues when trying to access the tools through Claude's MCP client interface.

## Next Steps

1. **VSCode Extension**: The VSCode MCP extension might need to be restarted or reconfigured to properly connect to the MCP server.
2. **MCP Server Connection**: Verify that the SSE endpoint is properly configured and accessible.
3. **Integration Testing**: Continue integration testing with other IPFS accelerate functionality once the MCP connection issues are resolved.

This report demonstrates that the IPFS tools are correctly implemented and exposed through the MCP server. The server is functional and properly registers all tools and resources, making them available via HTTP endpoints. The connection issue with the MCP client interface appears to be related to the client connection rather than server implementation.
