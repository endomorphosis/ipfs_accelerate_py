## Running Real Benchmarks

> **IMPORTANT**: The benchmark system now runs REAL benchmarks, not simulations or mock benchmarks. This ensures accurate, real-world performance data for all hardware-model combinations.

### Running Comprehensive Benchmarks

To run benchmarks for all model types across all available hardware:

```bash
python execute_comprehensive_benchmarks.py --run-all
```

To run benchmarks for specific models and hardware platforms:

```bash
python execute_comprehensive_benchmarks.py --run-all --model bert t5 --hardware cuda webgpu
```

For faster testing with smaller model variants:

```bash
python execute_comprehensive_benchmarks.py --run-all --small-models
```

### Error Handling and Reporting

All benchmark executions now include comprehensive error handling:

1. **Full Error Capture**: If a benchmark fails, the exact error message is captured and included in the results
2. **Detailed Error Classification**: Errors are classified as one of:
   - `timeout`: Benchmark exceeded the maximum allowed time
   - `execution_error`: Command execution failed with an error code
   - `unexpected_error`: Other unexpected exceptions occurred
3. **Error Output Preservation**: All stderr output is preserved in the benchmark results
4. **Execution Tracing**: Each benchmark records the exact command executed

This allows for detailed troubleshooting and ensures no failed benchmarks are silently ignored.

### Generating Reports

To generate a comprehensive report in HTML format:

```bash
python duckdb_api/run_benchmark_timing_report.py --generate
```

To specify an output file and format:

```bash
python duckdb_api/run_benchmark_timing_report.py --generate --format markdown --output benchmark_report.md
```

Available formats:
- `html`: HTML report with interactive visualizations
- `markdown` or `md`: Markdown report for GitHub or documentation
- `json`: Machine-readable JSON format for further processing

### Querying Raw Benchmark Timing Data

To view raw benchmark timing data in a tabular format:

```bash
python duckdb_api/query_benchmark_timings.py
```

This will display a table showing:
- Model names
- Hardware types
- Batch sizes
- Average latency (ms)
- Throughput (items/sec)
- Memory usage (MB)

Example output:
```

      "throughput_items_per_second": 128.0,
      "memory_peak_mb": 2048.0,
      "created_at": "2025-04-10T15:30:00"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

## Interactive Dashboard Features

The interactive dashboard provides:

1. **Model Filtering**: Select specific models to analyze
2. **Hardware Filtering**: Compare specific hardware platforms
3. **Metric Selection**: Switch between latency, throughput, and memory usage
4. **Performance Comparison Charts**: Visual comparison of performance metrics
5. **Raw Data Table**: Detailed view of the underlying data
6. **Performance Analysis**: Best hardware for each model type

## Interpreting the Results

### Latency (Lower is Better)

Latency represents the time it takes for a model to process a single input. Lower values indicate better performance.

### Throughput (Higher is Better)

Throughput measures how many items the model can process per second. Higher values indicate better performance.

### Memory Usage (Context-Dependent)

Memory usage shows the peak memory consumption during inference. Lower values are generally better, but adequate memory is necessary for model functionality.

## Example Optimization Recommendations

The report provides optimization recommendations based on the benchmark results:

- Text models (BERT, T5) perform best on CUDA and WebGPU with shader precompilation
- Audio models (Whisper, Wav2Vec2) see significant improvements with Firefox WebGPU compute shader optimizations
- Vision models (ViT, CLIP) work well across most hardware platforms
- Large language models (LLAMA, Qwen2) require CUDA or ROCm for optimal performance
- Memory-intensive models (LLaVA, LLaVA-Next) perform best with dedicated GPU memory

## Comprehensive Benchmark Execution

The benchmark system now includes two primary tools for executing comprehensive benchmarks:

1. **`run_comprehensive_benchmarks.py`**: A new user-friendly orchestration script with enhanced features (April 2025)
2. **`execute_comprehensive_benchmarks.py`**: The core benchmark execution engine 

Together, these tools orchestrate the execution of benchmarks across all models and hardware platforms, store the results in the database, and generate comprehensive reports.

### Architecture Overview

![Benchmark System Architecture](https://mermaid.ink/img/pako:eNqNVE1v2zAM_SuETgPaTFnXXRZ0HTBgDdCh23LoZShw7ToRJluGLG9NFvS_j7KdJnG3YofAEMXHx0c-0hE4X3BYwp5LRcCkVaxUnEIheVWU0FZCJHMnKw9cVWUh5QE-iBc4SCOYCPZsiQzxnW60J7VmpcoZDa0r1BdaUr2SOGDNqzZxaBrOPFpZZ62vVDRfRAnKfqqBE4zC4V5WVtWMFTB_mX_G-dOXWoibQCahHOCl41j50gFb5obTAD8vvgUY_fAlnU0WFxcL91QGnOZgGAn0YiIISmZypqaFHddEiTv0tIBBbZYsYKBtIFbXO2FroZ9tK3HQFk-26uCf-MQQfVcbJX3H_mRDqHdPBuZAMeVoUJjSqWJIU8uK8nRNZeFADnIEhZTmgHcrHWMeqSp9YZr25ybq2RaP0MYrYpR_oeFvttMK6lmwt9XeHzTfVh_oQiqIu4L_S5jtlvnezgBNXrb9n2OuMPPfxdJmgjrGtttbJjd5-MXQjkHQAWLCpSdW0TLxZ-1LFnAP6Xw1W6Wpn6FmbrFiTrvYLxpX7mCh8hbYo8l8m1OPSKvvexZHuxSs6kpYXKnSW_qvHMmCmV9rSBtDX91zcfdA4AhCZN4wf9rHcuLfvGV72s6QJ2nWruuYZZ9I0wX51XVvZ1C1ot-n9zb2bzbkP9O5cVgJg8PDTzl0CkgY5pXkYciJeFwJ11gHUhXakw0K2YOuPpEzDxZ5IxeHTzd96rzvBJUcMF-LF_fA1f76jPOz51wCBUaQfn8WIzOg-FZzRw8cQNy9HNLxFw6u0tk?type=png)

The benchmark execution system follows a structured workflow:

1. **Configuration and Setup**
   - Parses command-line arguments for model types, hardware platforms, and benchmark parameters
   - Sets up output directory for benchmark results and reports
   - Configures logging for detailed tracking of benchmark execution

2. **Hardware Detection**
   - Detects available hardware platforms on the system
   - Determines which hardware platforms can be tested
   - Optionally skips unavailable hardware platforms

3. **Benchmark Orchestration**
   - Iterates through all model-hardware combinations
   - For each combination, executes the benchmark_hardware_models.py script
   - Tracks progress and handles errors gracefully
   - Stores results in JSON files and in the DuckDB database

4. **Progress Tracking**
   - Maintains a record of completed, failed, and skipped benchmarks
   - Saves progress information to JSON files for monitoring
   - Provides real-time updates on benchmark execution status

5. **Report Generation**
   - After all benchmarks are complete, generates a comprehensive timing report
   - Creates visualizations for comparative analysis
   - Produces HTML, Markdown, or JSON reports based on configuration

This architecture ensures robust benchmark execution, comprehensive data collection, and detailed reporting of benchmark results across all model types and hardware platforms.

### Basic Usage

#### Using the New User-Friendly Script (Recommended)

To run benchmarks with the enhanced orchestration script:

```bash
python duckdb_api/run_comprehensive_benchmarks.py
```

This will:
1. Auto-detect available hardware platforms (CPU, CUDA, etc.)
2. Run benchmarks for a default set of models (bert, t5, vit, whisper)
3. Use smaller model variants for faster testing
4. Store results in the default database (./benchmark_db.duckdb)
5. Generate a comprehensive timing report

To specify models and hardware:

```bash
python duckdb_api/run_comprehensive_benchmarks.py --models bert,t5,vit --hardware cpu,cuda
```

To specify batch sizes and report format:

```bash
python duckdb_api/run_comprehensive_benchmarks.py --batch-sizes 1,4,16 --report-format markdown
```

To force benchmarking on specific hardware platforms (even if not available):

```bash
python duckdb_api/run_comprehensive_benchmarks.py --force-hardware rocm,webgpu
```

To list available hardware platforms without running benchmarks:

```bash
python duckdb_api/run_comprehensive_benchmarks.py --list-available-hardware
```

#### Using the Core Execution Script

You can also directly use the core execution script if needed:

```bash
python execute_comprehensive_benchmarks.py --run-all
```

To run benchmarks for specific models and hardware platforms:

```bash
python execute_comprehensive_benchmarks.py --run-all --model bert t5 --hardware cuda webgpu
```

To use smaller model variants for faster benchmarking:

```bash
python execute_comprehensive_benchmarks.py --run-all --small-models
```

### Monitoring Progress

#### Enhanced Status Tracking

The enhanced orchestration script provides comprehensive status tracking through:

1. **Status Files**: Automatically generates detailed JSON status files with timestamps
   - `benchmark_status_<timestamp>.json`: Snapshot of each benchmark run
   - `benchmark_status_latest.json`: Always points to the most recent run

2. **Real-time Output**: Displays real-time output from the benchmark process
   - Shows progress for each model-hardware combination
   - Provides timing information and error details
   - Updates as benchmarks complete or fail

3. **Detailed Error Tracking**: Captures and reports detailed error information
   - Classifies errors by type (timeout, execution error, etc.)
   - Captures stdout/stderr for debugging
   - Includes timing information for failures
   - Logs command details for reproducibility

To check the status of your benchmark run:

```bash
# View the latest status report
cat benchmark_results/benchmark_status_latest.json

# Check real-time progress in the log file
tail -f comprehensive_benchmarks_run.log
```

#### Legacy Progress Tracking

The core execution script also saves progress during execution to:
- `benchmark_progress_<timestamp>.json`
- `benchmark_progress_latest.json`

These files contain information about completed, failed, and skipped benchmarks.

### Generating Reports Only

To generate a report from existing benchmark data without running new benchmarks:

```bash
python execute_comprehensive_benchmarks.py --generate-report --report-format html
```

## Advanced Usage

```yaml
# GitHub Actions workflow example
jobs:
  benchmark_report:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v4
        with:
          python-version: '3.9'
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install -r requirements.txt
      - name: Generate benchmark timing report

        with:
          name: benchmark-report
          path: benchmark_report.html
```

### Programmatic Usage for Report Generation

You can use the BenchmarkTimingReport class programmatically:

```python
from benchmark_timing_report import BenchmarkTimingReport

# Initialize with database path
report_gen = BenchmarkTimingReport(db_path="./benchmark_db.duckdb")

# Generate HTML report
report_path = report_gen.generate_timing_report(
    output_format="html",
    output_path="custom_report.html",
    days_lookback=60
)

print(f"Report generated: {report_path}")
```

### Programmatic Usage for Benchmark Execution

#### Using the Enhanced Orchestration API

You can programmatically use the enhanced benchmark orchestration:

```python
from run_comprehensive_benchmarks import detect_available_hardware, run_benchmarks

# Detect available hardware
available_hardware_dict = detect_available_hardware()
available_hardware = [hw for hw, available in available_hardware_dict.items() if available]
print(f"Available hardware: {available_hardware}")

# Run benchmarks with custom configuration
success = run_benchmarks(
    models=["bert", "t5", "vit"],
    hardware=["cpu", "cuda"],
    batch_sizes=[1, 4, 16],
    small_models=True,
    db_path="./benchmark_db.duckdb",
    output_dir="./custom_results",
    timeout=1200,
    report_format="markdown",
    force_hardware=["rocm"]
)

if success:
    print("Benchmarks completed successfully!")
else:
    print("Benchmarks failed. Check logs for details.")
```

#### Using the Core Execution API

You can also use the ComprehensiveBenchmarkOrchestrator class programmatically:

```python
from execute_comprehensive_benchmarks import ComprehensiveBenchmarkOrchestrator

# Initialize orchestrator
orchestrator = ComprehensiveBenchmarkOrchestrator(
    db_path="./benchmark_db.duckdb",
    output_dir="./benchmark_results",
    small_models=True,
    batch_sizes=[1, 4, 16]
)

# Run benchmarks for specific models and hardware
results = orchestrator.run_all_benchmarks(
    model_types=["bert", "t5"],

```

### Integration with Benchmark Database Query System

The timing report is integrated with the benchmark database query system:

```bash
python benchmark_db_query.py --report timing --format html --output timing_report.html
```

## Error Handling and Troubleshooting

### Error Categories and Reporting

The benchmark system now captures and classifies all errors into specific categories to aid in troubleshooting:

1. **Timeout Errors** (`timeout`): Benchmarks that exceed the maximum allowed execution time
   - Configurable timeout period via `--timeout` parameter (default: 600 seconds)
   - Example error: `Benchmark timed out after 600 seconds`
   - Common causes: Large models, insufficient hardware resources, batch size too large

2. **Execution Errors** (`execution_error`): Errors that occur during command execution
   - Complete stderr output is captured for analysis
   - Exit code is recorded for system-level troubleshooting
   - Common causes: 
     - Out of memory (OOM): `CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 2.20 GiB`
     - Model not found: `Model 'nonexistent-model' not found`
     - Hardware errors: `CUDA driver version is insufficient for CUDA runtime version`
     - Import errors: `ImportError: No module named 'transformers'`

3. **JSON Parse Errors** (`json_parse_error`): Errors parsing benchmark result output
   - Raw stdout and stderr are preserved for manual inspection
   - Common causes: Malformed JSON output, command output mixed with error messages

4. **Result Processing Errors** (`result_processing_error`): Errors processing benchmark results
   - Complete benchmark output is preserved
   - Common causes: Unexpected output format, missing expected metrics

5. **Unexpected Errors** (`unexpected_error`): Other unexpected exceptions
   - Full exception information is captured
   - Complete command history is recorded for reproduction
   - Common causes: System issues, resource conflicts, permissions problems

### Error Reporting in Database

All errors are stored in the database with comprehensive metadata:

```sql
-- Error information in performance_results table
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS performance_results (
    -- ... existing fields ...
    status VARCHAR,                   -- "success" or "failed"
    error_type VARCHAR,               -- One of the error categories above
    error_message TEXT,               -- Full error message
    command_executed TEXT,            -- The exact command that was executed
    stdout TEXT,                      -- Standard output (if available)
    stderr TEXT,                      -- Standard error (if available)
    execution_time_sec FLOAT,         -- Time spent until error occurred
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Detailed error tracking
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS benchmark_errors (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    performance_id INTEGER,
    error_type VARCHAR,
    error_message TEXT,
    error_details JSON,               -- Detailed error information
    stack_trace TEXT,                 -- Stack trace if available
    system_info JSON,                 -- System information at time of error
    reproduction_steps TEXT,          -- Steps to reproduce the error
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (performance_id) REFERENCES performance_results(id)
);
```

### Error Visualization and Analysis

The benchmark timing report includes dedicated error visualization tools:

1. **Error Distribution Chart**: Visualizes the distribution of error types across models and hardware
2. **Error Timeline**: Shows when errors occurred during benchmark execution
3. **Error Correlation Analysis**: Identifies patterns in errors across models and hardware
4. **Error Rate by Model Type**: Shows which model types experience the most errors
5. **Error Rate by Hardware**: Shows which hardware platforms experience the most errors

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. Database Issues

**Database Not Found**: Ensure the database path is correct and accessible
```
Error: Database not found at: ./benchmark_db.duckdb
```
- **Solution**: Specify the correct path with `--db-path` or set the `BENCHMARK_DB_PATH` environment variable
- **Command**: `export BENCHMARK_DB_PATH=/path/to/benchmark_db.duckdb`

**No Data Available**: No benchmark data found in the database
```
Warning: No benchmark data available
```
- **Solution**: Run benchmarks first to populate the database
- **Command**: `python execute_comprehensive_benchmarks.py --run-all --small-models`

#### 2. Hardware-Related Issues

**CUDA Out of Memory (OOM)**: Not enough GPU memory for the benchmark
```
CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 2.20 GiB. GPU memory usage: 14.7/16.0 GiB
```
- **Solutions**:
  - Reduce batch size: `--batch-sizes 1,2,4`
  - Use smaller models: `--small-models`
  - Free GPU memory: `nvidia-smi -r`
  - Monitor GPU usage: `watch -n 1 nvidia-smi`

**Hardware Not Available**: Required hardware is not available or properly configured
```
No CUDA GPUs available
```
- **Solutions**:
  - Skip unavailable hardware: `--skip-unsupported`
  - Force testing on CPU only: `--hardware cpu`
  - Check drivers and installations: `nvidia-smi`, `rocm-smi`

#### 3. Model-Related Issues

**Model Not Found**: The specified model could not be found
```
403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://huggingface.co/api/models/nonexistent-model
```
- **Solutions**:
  - Check model name: Verify spelling and availability
  - Use available models: `--list-models` to see available models
  - Use local models: `--local-models`

**Model Too Large**: Model is too large for available resources
```
NotEnoughMemoryException: Not enough memory to load model
```
- **Solutions**: 
  - Use smaller models: `--small-models`
  - Reduce batch size: `--batch-sizes 1`
  - Try different hardware: `--hardware cuda` or other available platform

#### 4. Benchmark Execution Issues

**Timeout Errors**: Benchmark took too long to complete
```
Benchmark timed out after 600 seconds
```
- **Solutions**:
  - Increase timeout: `--timeout 1200`
  - Reduce batch size: `--batch-sizes 1,2`
  - Use smaller models: `--small-models`

**Missing Dependencies**: Required packages are not installed
```
ImportError: No module named 'streamlit'
```
- **Solution**: Install the required packages
  - For core functionality: `pip install duckdb pandas matplotlib seaborn`
  - For interactive dashboard: `pip install streamlit`
  - For specific hardware: Check HARDWARE_PLATFORM_TEST_GUIDE.md

### Interpreting Error Messages

When analyzing benchmark errors, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the error type**: Determine the category of error (timeout, execution, etc.)
2. **Review the complete error message**: Read the full error message for specific details
3. **Check the command that was executed**: Verify the exact command that caused the error
4. **Examine stdout and stderr**: Review the standard output and error streams for clues
5. **Consider resource constraints**: Check if memory, disk space, or other resources are limited
6. **Verify hardware availability**: Ensure required hardware is available and properly configured
7. **Check model compatibility**: Verify that the model is compatible with the hardware

### Error Recovery Strategies

The benchmark system includes several strategies for recovering from errors:

1. **Automatic retry**: For transient errors, benchmarks are automatically retried once
2. **Skip failing benchmarks**: Failed benchmarks are skipped to allow others to continue
3. **Fall back to simpler configurations**: When possible, fall back to simpler batch sizes or models
4. **Detailed logging**: Comprehensive logging to aid in post-run analysis
5. **Progress tracking**: Continuous progress tracking to allow resuming from failures

### Using the Error Report

To view a detailed error report:

```bash
# Generate a report focusing on errors
python run_benchmark_timing_report.py --generate --error-analysis --output error_report.html

# Query raw error data
python query_benchmark_timings.py --errors-only

# Get detailed error logs for specific model and hardware
python query_benchmark_timings.py --model bert --hardware cuda --error-details
```
