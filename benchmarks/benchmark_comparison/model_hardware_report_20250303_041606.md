## Performance Benchmark Summary

## Conclusions and Recommendations

### Hardware Platform Selection


### Model Selection

- Use Qwen/Qwen2-0.5B-Instruct as an efficient alternative for text_generation tasks in resource-constrained environments
- Use TinyLlama/TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0 as an efficient alternative for text_generation tasks in resource-constrained environments
- Use facebook/deit-tiny-patch16-224 as an efficient alternative for vision tasks in resource-constrained environments
- Use google/t5-efficient-tiny as an efficient alternative for text_generation tasks in resource-constrained environments
- Use openai/whisper-tiny as an efficient alternative for audio tasks in resource-constrained environments
- Use prajjwal1/bert-tiny as an efficient alternative for embedding tasks in resource-constrained environments

### Implementation Improvements

- Complete the implementation of t5 on openvino: OpenVINO implementation mocked - needs actual implementation
- Complete the implementation of clap on openvino: OpenVINO implementation mocked - needs actual implementation
- Complete the implementation of wav2vec2 on openvino: OpenVINO implementation mocked - needs actual implementation
- Complete the implementation of xclip on webnn: XCLIP not implemented for webnn
- Complete the implementation of xclip on webgpu: XCLIP not implemented for webgpu
- Complete the implementation of qwen2 on openvino: Qwen2 has limited implementation on openvino

### Ongoing Monitoring

- Regularly benchmark all model-hardware combinations to track performance changes with framework updates
- Add performance regression tests to CI/CD pipeline to catch performance regressions early
