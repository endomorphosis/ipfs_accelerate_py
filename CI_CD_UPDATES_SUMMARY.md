# CI/CD Updates for Reorganized Directory Structure

## Overview

This document summarizes the updates made to the CI/CD workflows following the codebase reorganization from the original structure to the new directory structure:

Original Structure:
- Tests and generators in `/test/` directory
- CI/CD workflows in `/test/.github/workflows/`

New Structure:
- Generators moved to top-level `/generators/` directory
- Database-related tools moved to top-level `/duckdb_api/` directory
- Web platform implementations in `/fixed_web_platform/` directory
- CI/CD workflows moved to standard `/.github/workflows/` location

## Workflow Files Updated

The following workflow files have been updated to use the new directory structure:

1. **test_and_benchmark.yml**
   - Updated monitored paths to include `generators/**` and `duckdb_api/**` instead of `test/**`
   - Path references already pointed to new directories for scripts

2. **benchmark_db_ci.yml**
   - Updated monitored paths to include `generators/**` and `duckdb_api/**` instead of `test/**`
   - Script paths already pointed to new directories

3. **integration_tests.yml**
   - No path monitoring changes needed
   - Script paths already updated 

4. **update_compatibility_matrix.yml**
   - No path monitoring changes needed
   - Script paths already updated to reference `duckdb_api/visualization/`

5. **test_results_integration.yml**
   - Updated monitored paths to include `generators/**` and `duckdb_api/**` instead of `test/**`
   - Script paths already updated to reference new directories

## Key Path Changes

All workflow files now reference paths in the new directory structure:

- Script paths use: 
  - `generators/models/test_ipfs_accelerate.py` 
  - `duckdb_api/core/run_benchmark_with_db.py`
  - `duckdb_api/visualization/generate_compatibility_matrix.py`
  - `duckdb_api/scripts/create_benchmark_schema.py`

- Monitored paths changed from:
  ```yaml
  paths:
    - 'test/**'
    - 'hardware_test_templates/**'
    - 'fixed_web_platform/**'
  ```
  
  To:
  ```yaml
  paths:
    - 'generators/**'
    - 'duckdb_api/**'
    - 'fixed_web_platform/**'
  ```

## Environment Variables

Environment variables remain the same:
```yaml
env:
  BENCHMARK_DB_PATH: ./benchmark_db.duckdb
  DEPRECATE_JSON_OUTPUT: 1
  PYTHONPATH: ${{ github.workspace }}
```

## Local Testing Commands

To test workflows locally with the new directory structure:

```bash
# Run model tests
python generators/models/test_ipfs_accelerate.py --models "bert-base-uncased" --endpoints cpu

# Run benchmarks with database integration
python duckdb_api/core/run_benchmark_with_db.py --models bert-base-uncased --hardware cpu

# Generate compatibility matrix
python duckdb_api/visualization/generate_compatibility_matrix.py --format markdown --output compatibility_matrix.md

# Create benchmark database schema
python duckdb_api/scripts/create_benchmark_schema.py --output benchmark_db.duckdb --sample-data

# Run regression detection
python duckdb_api/analysis/benchmark_regression_detector.py --db benchmark_db.duckdb --run-id "test" --threshold 0.1
```

## Next Steps

The CI/CD workflow files have been successfully updated to work with the new directory structure. However, you may need to:

1. Verify that all the referenced script files actually exist in the new locations
2. Update any additional import statements inside the scripts to reflect the new module paths
3. Run test workflows manually to verify everything works as expected
4. Update any documentation references to workflows or paths

The first full CI/CD run with the updated structure will validate these changes and ensure everything works correctly.

## Implementation Status

✅ Workflow files moved to standard `.github/workflows/` location  
✅ Path references updated to use new directory structure  
✅ Script paths already using correct directory organization  
✅ Trigger paths updated to monitor new directory structure  
✅ Verification script created to check path validity  
✅ Migration script created for moving files  
✅ Required files moved to their expected locations  
✅ All workflows updated to use new file paths  
✅ Final verification run completed successfully  

### Completed on: March 10, 2025

The migration of CI/CD workflows to work with the reorganized directory structure is now complete. All workflow files have been updated to monitor the new directory paths and execute scripts from their new locations.

## Path Verification Results

The verification script initially identified several missing files that were referenced in the CI/CD workflows but didn't exist at the expected locations. All these issues have now been resolved.

### Initially Missing Files (Now Migrated)

| Previously Missing Path | Original Location | Status |
|-------------------------|-------------------|--------|
| duckdb_api/analysis/benchmark_regression_detector.py | test/scripts/benchmark_regression_detector.py | ✅ Migrated |
| duckdb_api/core/run_benchmark_with_db.py | test/duckdb_api/core/run_benchmark_with_db.py | ✅ Migrated |
| duckdb_api/scripts/ci_benchmark_integrator.py | test/scripts/ci_benchmark_integrator.py | ✅ Migrated |
| duckdb_api/scripts/create_benchmark_schema.py | test/scripts/benchmark_db/create_benchmark_schema.py | ✅ Migrated |
| duckdb_api/visualization/generate_compatibility_matrix.py | generators/generate_compatibility_matrix.py | ✅ Migrated |
| duckdb_api/visualization/generate_enhanced_compatibility_matrix.py | generators/generate_enhanced_compatibility_matrix.py | ✅ Migrated |
| fixed_web_platform/web_platform_test_runner.py | test/archive/web_platform_test_runner.py | ✅ Migrated |
| generators/models/test_ipfs_accelerate.py | test/test_ipfs_accelerate.py | ✅ Migrated |
| generators/test_runners/integration_test_suite.py | test/integration_test_suite.py | ✅ Migrated |
| predictive_performance/hardware_model_predictor.py | test/archive/hardware_model_predictor.py | ✅ Migrated |
| predictive_performance/model_performance_predictor.py | test/archive/model_performance_predictor.py | ✅ Migrated |

### Final Verification Result

All script paths referenced in the CI/CD workflows now exist in the proper locations, and all workflows have been updated to use the new directory structure. A final verification run confirmed that all paths are correct.

## File Migration Script

A migration script has been created to automate moving the missing files to their expected locations:

```bash
# Run the migration script in dry-run mode first to see what would happen
python migrate_files_for_ci.py

# Then run for real by answering 'n' to dry-run question
python migrate_files_for_ci.py
```

The script will:
1. Check if source files exist
2. Create necessary target directories
3. Copy files to their new locations
4. Generate a detailed migration report

The script uses the migration map based on the verification results and supports a dry-run mode to preview changes before executing them.

## Verification Script

A script has been created to verify that all paths referenced in CI/CD workflows actually exist in the filesystem. This helps identify any files that may still need to be moved or created in the new directory structure.

```bash
# Run the script to check for missing referenced files
python verify_cicd_paths.py
```

The script will:
1. Find all Python script references in all workflow files
2. Check if each referenced file exists
3. Report any missing files with suggestions for possible locations
4. Provide a summary of found and missing files

Run this script before pushing changes to ensure all referenced files exist and before running CI/CD workflows with the new structure.

## Migration Progress and Status

The CI/CD workflow migration has been successfully completed, addressing the key issues that were discovered during implementation:

1. ✅ **Fixed Corrupted Python Files**: Three key files that were corrupted have been fixed by replacing them with clean versions and adding proper dependency handling:
   - `generators/models/test_ipfs_accelerate.py`
   - `duckdb_api/analysis/benchmark_regression_detector.py`
   - `generators/test_runners/integration_test_suite.py`

2. ✅ **Added Dependency Resilience**: The code has been modified to gracefully handle missing dependencies by:
   - Adding proper try/except blocks around optional dependency imports
   - Providing stub implementations where needed
   - Adding clear warning messages when optional features are disabled

3. ✅ **Completed Package Structure**: A proper Python package structure has been created:
   - Created `__init__.py` files in all module directories
   - Fixed import issues to ensure modules can be imported correctly
   - Organized code into logical modules and packages

4. ✅ **Verified Imports**: All references in CI/CD workflows now resolve to existing files, and files can be imported without errors.

## Next Steps

While the major migration work is complete, there are some refinements that should be addressed:

1. **Fix Remaining Warnings**: Some string literals contain invalid escape sequences that generate warnings but don't prevent execution.

2. **Create Requirements Documentation**: A comprehensive requirements.txt file should be created to document all dependencies.

3. **Complete Developer Documentation**: Update all documentation to reflect the new structure and provide guidance for developers.

See `/migration_logs/migration_issues.md` for a detailed report on the migration process, including what was fixed and what remains to be addressed.
