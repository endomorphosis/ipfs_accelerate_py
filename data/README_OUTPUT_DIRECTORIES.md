# Data Directory - Test and Screenshot Outputs

This directory contains output files generated by tests, screenshots, and other tools to keep the root directory clean.

## Directory Structure

### `test_screenshots/`
Test screenshots organized by test type:

- **`test_screenshots/`** - General MCP dashboard test screenshots
- **`test_screenshots/workflow/`** - HuggingFace workflow test screenshots  
- **`test_screenshots/validation/`** - Comprehensive validation test screenshots
- **`test_screenshots/ui_test/`** - Kitchen sink UI test screenshots
- **`test_screenshots/model_manager/`** - Model manager dashboard test screenshots

**Generated by:**
- `test/test_mcp_dashboard_playwright.py`
- `test/test_huggingface_workflow.py`
- `test/test_comprehensive_validation.py`
- `test/ui_test_script.py`
- `test/test_model_manager_dashboard.py`

### `screenshots/`
Screenshots from various tools and demos:

- **`screenshots/kitchen_sink/`** - Kitchen sink interface screenshots
- **`screenshots/sdk_dashboard/`** - SDK dashboard screenshots

**Generated by:**
- `tools/simple_screenshot_test.py`
- `tools/selenium_screenshot_tester.py`
- `test/playwright_pipeline_screenshots.py`
- `tools/sdk_browser_automation_test.py`

### `final_screenshot_summary/`
Screenshot summaries and visual documentation:

- `tools/final_screenshot_summary.py`

## Why This Structure?

Previously, screenshot and test output directories were created in the root directory, causing clutter. All output directories are now organized under `data/` to:

1. **Keep root clean** - Easier to navigate the project structure
2. **Logical organization** - Related outputs grouped together
3. **Easy cleanup** - Single directory to clean or gitignore
4. **Consistent patterns** - All test outputs in predictable locations

## Gitignore

These directories are excluded from git via `.gitignore`:
```
data/test_screenshots/
data/screenshots/
data/final_screenshot_summary/
```

## Cleaning Up

To remove all test screenshots and outputs:

```bash
rm -rf data/test_screenshots/ data/screenshots/ data/final_screenshot_summary/
```

The directories will be automatically recreated when tests run.

## Legacy Directories

The following root-level directories are deprecated:
- `test_screenshots/` - Now `data/test_screenshots/`
- `final_screenshot_summary/` - Now `data/final_screenshot_summary/`

Legacy directories may still contain old screenshots but new tests write to `data/`.
