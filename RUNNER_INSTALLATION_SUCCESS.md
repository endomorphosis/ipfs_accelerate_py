Your GitHub Actions runner has been successfully installed and is now running!

### 📊 Runner Details
- **Runner Name**: `fent-reactor`

- `self-hosted` - Self-hosted runner
- `linux` - Linux operating system
- `x64` - x86_64 architecture  
- `docker` - Docker support available
- `cuda` - NVIDIA GPU support
- `gpu` - Generic GPU support

### 🔍 Current Status
```bash
✓ Service is running and listening for jobs
✓ Connected to GitHub repository
✓ Ready to accept workflow jobs
✓ Auto-start enabled (will start on boot)
```

## 🛠️ Management Commands

### Service Control
```bash
# Check runner status
sudo systemctl status actions.runner.endomorphosis-ipfs_accelerate_py.fent-reactor.service

# Restart runner
sudo systemctl restart actions.runner.endomorphosis-ipfs_accelerate_py.fent-reactor.service

# Stop runner
sudo systemctl stop actions.runner.endomorphosis-ipfs_accelerate_py.fent-reactor.service

# Start runner
sudo systemctl start actions.runner.endomorphosis-ipfs_accelerate_py.fent-reactor.service
```

### Health Monitoring
```bash
# Quick health check
~/actions-runner/health-check.sh

# Detailed monitoring
~/actions-runner/monitor-runners.sh

# View recent logs
sudo journalctl -u actions.runner.endomorphosis-ipfs_accelerate_py.fent-reactor.service -f
```

### Manual Operation
```bash
# Run manually (if service is stopped)
cd ~/actions-runner
./run.sh
```

## 🎯 Verification

### 1. Check in GitHub Repository
Go to: https://github.com/endomorphosis/ipfs_accelerate_py/settings/actions/runners

You should see:
- ✅ `fent-reactor` runner listed as "Online"
- ✅ Status: "Idle" (waiting for jobs)
- ✅ Labels: `self-hosted`, `linux`, `x64`, `docker`, `cuda`, `gpu`

### 2. Test Runner
Create a simple workflow to test your runner:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/test-runner.yml
name: Test Self-Hosted Runner
on: workflow_dispatch

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: [self-hosted, linux]
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Test runner
        run: |
          echo "Runner: $(hostname)"
          echo "OS: $(uname -a)"
          echo "Python: $(python3 --version)"
          echo "Docker: $(docker --version)"
          nvidia-smi || echo "GPU not available in this context"
```

## 🔄 Setting Up Backup Runner (Optional)

If you want to add a backup runner on this same machine:

```bash
cd /home/barberb/ipfs_accelerate_py

# Get a new token from GitHub (same steps as before)
./scripts/setup-backup-runner.sh YOUR_NEW_TOKEN
```

This will create a second runner (`fent-reactor-backup`) that can handle jobs when the primary is busy.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Runner appears offline in GitHub**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart actions.runner.endomorphosis-ipfs_accelerate_py.fent-reactor.service
   ```

2. **Jobs not running**
   - Check runner labels match workflow requirements
   - Verify runner is "Idle" in GitHub settings

3. **Service won't start**
   ```bash
   sudo journalctl -u actions.runner.endomorphosis-ipfs_accelerate_py.fent-reactor.service -f
   ```

4. **Update runner**
   - Runner auto-updates automatically
   - Manual update: Download new version and re-run config
