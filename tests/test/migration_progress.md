Migrated and fixed key generator files:

- `test_generator_with_resource_pool.py` moved to `generators/utils/`
- `resource_pool.py` moved to `generators/utils/`

All files have been fixed to work correctly with the new package structure and pass import verification tests.

Next steps:
1. Continue migrating the remaining files using `reorganize_codebase.py`
2. Update import statements across the codebase
3. Run comprehensive tests to ensure everything works as expected
