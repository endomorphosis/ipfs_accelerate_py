# TypeScript SDK Implementation Progress

## SharedTensor Implementation - Complete

The `SharedTensor` class has been successfully implemented in TypeScript with the following features:

- **Reference Counting**: Automatic memory management for tensors shared between models
- **Storage Type Support**: Support for different storage backends (CPU, WebGPU, WebNN)
- **Tensor Views**: Zero-copy slices of tensors for efficient memory usage
- **Memory Optimization**: Automatic memory cleanup for unused tensors
- **Cross-Model Sharing**: Intelligent tensor sharing between compatible models

### Implementation Details

The implementation consists of three main classes:

1. **SharedTensor**: Represents a tensor that can be shared between multiple models with reference counting
2. **SharedTensorView**: Represents a slice or subset of a SharedTensor
3. **TensorSharingManager**: Manages tensor registration, sharing, and memory optimization

The implementation also includes utility functions for identifying compatible models and creating demo instances.

### Usage Example

```typescript
import { TensorSharingManager } from './tensor/shared_tensor';

// Create a tensor sharing manager
const manager = new TensorSharingManager(1024); // 1GB max memory

// Register a shared tensor
const embedding = manager.registerSharedTensor(
  "bert_embedding",
  [1, 768],    // [batch_size, embedding_size]
  "webgpu",    // Store on GPU for efficiency
  "bert-base", // Producer model
  ["t5", "gpt2"], // Consumer models
  "float32"
);

// Get a shared tensor for a model
const t5Embedding = manager.getSharedTensor("bert_embedding", "t5");

// Create a view into a shared tensor
const embeddingView = manager.createTensorView(
  "bert_embedding",
  "bert_embedding_first_half",
  [0, 0],      // Start offset
  [1, 384],    // Half the embedding size
  "distilbert" // Model using the view
);

// Share tensor with additional models
manager.shareTensorBetweenModels(
  "bert_embedding",
  "bert-base",
  ["bart", "roberta"]
);

// Analyze sharing opportunities
const opportunities = manager.analyzeSharingOpportunities();

// Optimize memory usage
const result = manager.optimizeMemoryUsage();
```

## Next Steps

1. **WebGPU Backend Implementation**:
   - Implement the WebGPU backend for tensor operations
   - Create compute shaders for tensor operations
   - Implement tensor transfer between CPU and WebGPU

2. **WebNN Integration**:
   - Implement WebNN graph building for neural networks
   - Create WebNN backend for tensor operations
   - Build a fallback mechanism for browsers without WebNN

3. **Tensor Operations**:
   - Implement efficient matrix operations (matmul, transpose)
   - Implement tensor activation functions (relu, sigmoid, tanh)
   - Add tensor broadcasting for element-wise operations

4. **Model Implementations**:
   - Complete basic transformer model architecture
   - Implement ViT for vision tasks
   - Implement BERT for text embedding

## Implementation Notes

- The TypeScript implementation closely follows the Python version while using TypeScript-specific features like interfaces and type guards
- We've made the implementation more browser-friendly with proper memory management for limited browser environments
- The implementation includes explicit type definitions for better TypeScript integration
- We're using a more functional approach where appropriate while maintaining the class-based structure for core components
- Cross-model tensor sharing patterns are defined for common ML model combinations
