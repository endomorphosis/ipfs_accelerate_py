## Usage Examples

### Using the Error Handler

```python
from fixed_web_platform.unified_framework.error_handling import ErrorHandler

error_handler = ErrorHandler()

try:
    # Operation that might fail
    result = run_complex_operation()
except Exception as e:
    # Get detailed error information with context
    error_info = error_handler.handle_error(e, {"operation": "complex_operation", "params": params})
    
    # Check if error is recoverable
    if error_handler.is_recoverable(e):
        # Get recovery strategy
        strategy = error_handler.get_recovery_strategy(e)
        if strategy.get("should_retry", False):
            # Retry with the suggested delay
            delay = strategy.get("retry_delay", 1.0)
            # ... retry logic ...
    
    # Return standardized error response
    return error_handler.create_error_response(e, {"operation": "complex_operation"})
```

### Using Timeout Handling

```python
from fixed_web_platform.unified_framework.error_handling import with_timeout

try:
    # Run operation with timeout
    result = await with_timeout(
        complex_async_operation(),
        timeout_seconds=30,
        timeout_message="Operation timed out after 30 seconds"
    )
except TimeoutError as e:
    # Handle timeout specifically
    logger.error(f"Timeout error: {e}")
except Exception as e:
    # Handle other errors
    logger.error(f"Other error: {e}")
```

### Using Retry Mechanism

```python
from fixed_web_platform.unified_framework.error_handling import with_retry

# Define async function that might need retries
async def fetch_data_with_retry():
    result = await with_retry(
        coro_func=lambda: fetch_data(),  # Function that returns a coroutine
        max_retries=3,
        base_delay=1.0,
        max_delay=10.0,
        retry_on=[ConnectionError, TimeoutError],
        timeout_seconds=5,
        retry_condition=lambda e: "temporary" in str(e).lower()
    )
    return result
```

### Using Safe Resource Cleanup

```python
from fixed_web_platform.unified_framework.error_handling import safe_resource_cleanup

# Define cleanup functions
async def cleanup_database():
    # Database cleanup logic
    
async def cleanup_connections():
    # Connection cleanup logic
    
async def cleanup_files():
    # File cleanup logic
    
# Execute all cleanup functions safely
cleanup_results = await safe_resource_cleanup(
    [cleanup_database, cleanup_connections, cleanup_files], 
    logger
)

# Check for cleanup errors
if any(result is not None for result in cleanup_results):
    logger.warning("Some cleanup operations failed")
    # Handle partial cleanup
```
