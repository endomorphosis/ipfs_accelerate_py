from duckdb_api.distributed_testing.load_balancer_live_dashboard import LoadBalancerMonitor
from duckdb_api.distributed_testing.load_balancer import LoadBalancerService

# Create load balancer service
load_balancer = LoadBalancerService()
load_balancer.start()

# Create and start monitor
monitor = LoadBalancerMonitor(load_balancer)
monitor.start()

# Monitor will now show real-time dashboard in the terminal

# When done
monitor.stop()
load_balancer.stop()
```

For web-based monitoring with full dashboard:

```python
# Import the monitoring integration
from duckdb_api.distributed_testing.load_balancer.monitoring.integration import MonitoringIntegration
from duckdb_api.distributed_testing.coordinator import CoordinatorServer
from duckdb_api.distributed_testing.load_balancer import LoadBalancerService

# Create coordinator and load balancer
coordinator = CoordinatorServer(host="localhost", port=8888, db_path="test.db")
load_balancer = LoadBalancerService(db_manager=coordinator.db_manager)

# Create monitoring integration
monitoring = MonitoringIntegration(
    coordinator=coordinator,
    load_balancer=load_balancer,
    dashboard_host="localhost",
    dashboard_port=5000
)

# Start all components
coordinator.start()
load_balancer.start()
monitoring.start()

# Dashboard is now accessible at http://localhost:5000/

# When done
monitoring.stop()
load_balancer.stop()
coordinator.stop()
```

### Running Stress Tests with Live Monitoring

```bash
# Run stress test with worker churn scenario
python -m duckdb_api.distributed_testing.load_balancer_live_dashboard scenario worker_churn

# Run custom stress test with specific parameters
python -m duckdb_api.distributed_testing.load_balancer_live_dashboard stress \

# Run stress test with web dashboard
python -m duckdb_api.distributed_testing.load_balancer_live_dashboard stress \
  --workers 30 --tests 100 --duration 60 --web-dashboard --port 8080
```

### Running the Integrated System

A convenient bash script is provided to run the complete integrated system with Coordinator, Load Balancer, and Monitoring Dashboard:

```bash
# Basic usage with default settings
./run_integrated_system.sh

# Run with 10 mock workers and open web browser to dashboard
./run_integrated_system.sh --mock-workers 10 --open-browser

# Run with stress testing enabled
./run_integrated_system.sh --stress-test --test-tasks 50 --test-duration 120

# Run with terminal-based dashboard and work stealing enabled
./run_integrated_system.sh --terminal-dashboard --enable-work-stealing

# Run with custom ports and database path
./run_integrated_system.sh --coordinator-port 8888 --dashboard-port 5555 --db-path ./my_database.duckdb

# Show all available options
./run_integrated_system.sh --help
```

The script provides:

### Running Fault Tolerance Tests

A dedicated script is provided for running the fault tolerance tests:

```bash
# Run all fault tolerance tests
./run_fault_tolerance_tests.sh --all

# Run a specific fault tolerance test
./run_fault_tolerance_tests.sh --test test_06_worker_recovery

# Run tests with verbose output
./run_fault_tolerance_tests.sh --all --verbose

# Save test output to a specific log file
./run_fault_tolerance_tests.sh --all --log-file my_test_run.log

# Show all available options
./run_fault_tolerance_tests.sh --help
```

The fault tolerance tests verify that the system can handle various failure scenarios:
- Worker process crashes
- Network disconnections (simulated by killing workers)
- Multiple simultaneous failures
- Worker recovery and reconnection
- Task reassignment and migration
- Continued operation despite failures

These tests are particularly important for validating the robustness of the distributed testing framework in real-world environments where failures are inevitable.

### Running the Complete Test Suite

A combined test script is provided to run all types of tests with unified logging and reporting:

```bash
# Run all tests
./run_all_tests.sh

# Run only fault tolerance tests
./run_all_tests.sh --type fault

# Run only monitoring tests
./run_all_tests.sh --type monitoring

# Run only integration tests with a filter
./run_all_tests.sh --type integration --filter load_balancer

# Run tests with verbose output
./run_all_tests.sh --type all --verbose

# Specify a log directory
./run_all_tests.sh --log-dir my_test_results

# Show all available options
./run_all_tests.sh --help
```

The combined test script provides:
- A unified interface for running all types of tests
- Organized logging with a timestamp-based directory structure
- Detailed test summaries showing pass/fail status
- The ability to run specific test types or all tests
- Test filtering for more focused test runs

python -m duckdb_api.distributed_testing.tests.run_integration_tests --test load_balancer_monitoring

# Run a specific test case
python -m duckdb_api.distributed_testing.tests.run_integration_tests \
  --case LoadBalancerMonitoringIntegrationTest.test_04_websocket_real_time_updates

# List all available tests
python -m duckdb_api.distributed_testing.tests.run_integration_tests --list
```

### Customizing Scheduler Behavior

The load balancer supports multiple schedulers that can be configured based on test type or model family:

```python
load_balancer_config = {
    "default_scheduler": {
        "type": "composite",
        "algorithms": [
            {"type": "performance_based", "weight": 0.6},
            {"type": "priority_based", "weight": 0.3},
            {"type": "round_robin", "weight": 0.1}
        ]
    },
    "test_type_schedulers": {
        "performance": {"type": "performance_based"},
        "compatibility": {"type": "affinity_based"}
    },
    "model_family_schedulers": {
        "vision": {"type": "performance_based"},
        "text": {"type": "weighted_round_robin"},
        "audio": {"type": "affinity_based"}
    }
}
```

### Customizing Dashboard Visualization

The web-based dashboard supports customization of displayed metrics and visualization options:

```javascript
// In static/dashboard.js
const dashboardConfig = {
    refreshInterval: 1000,  // 1 second refresh
    charts: {
        systemMetrics: {
            enabled: true,
            metrics: ['total_workers', 'active_workers', 'queued_tasks', 'running_tasks', 'throughput'],
            timeRange: '5m'  // 5 minute window
        },
        workerUtilization: {
            enabled: true,
            sortBy: 'utilization',  // Sort workers by utilization
            limit: 20  // Show top 20 workers
        },
        taskQueue: {
            enabled: true,
            groupBy: 'priority'
        },
        anomalies: {
            enabled: true,
            severity: 'medium'  // Show medium and high severity anomalies
        }
    }
};
```
