### Algorithm Approach

1. **Test Classification**
   - Categorize tests by resource requirements
   - Identify tests that benefit from specialized hardware
   - Group similar tests for batch assignment

2. **Worker Classification**
   - Group workers by capability profiles
   - Calculate current and projected load
   - Assign suitability scores for different test types

3. **Matching Strategy**
   - Apply multi-factor scoring for worker-test combinations
   - Consider current load, historical performance, and capabilities
   - Prioritize high-value assignments while maintaining fairness

4. **Dynamic Adaptation**
   - Monitor execution progress and worker health
   - Rebalance work when performance deviates from expectations
   - Apply continuous learning to improve future assignments

## Integration Points

- **Coordinator**: Receives test assignment requests and reports completion
- **Worker**: Provides capability information and accepts test assignments
- **ResultAggregator**: Provides historical performance data for optimization
- **HealthMonitor**: Reports worker health status and anomalies
- **Dashboard**: Visualizes load distribution and balancing metrics

## Evaluation Metrics

- **Load Distribution Fairness**: Gini coefficient of worker utilization
- **Resource Utilization**: Average CPU, memory, and GPU utilization
- **Execution Time Reduction**: Comparison with baseline scheduling
- **Adaptation Speed**: Time to rebalance after worker addition/removal
