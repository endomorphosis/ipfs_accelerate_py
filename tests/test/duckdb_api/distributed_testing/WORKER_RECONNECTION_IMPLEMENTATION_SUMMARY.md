### Recently Fixed Issues

1. **Task Execution Recursion Error**
   - ✅ FIXED: Resolved the recursion error in task execution
   - The issue was caused by the `_task_executor_wrapper` method in the `EnhancedWorkerReconnectionPlugin` calling `execute_task_with_metrics`, which would then call back to the task executor, creating an infinite loop
   - Fixed by modifying both methods to prevent the recursive loop and ensuring metrics are tracked at the appropriate level

2. **Message Type Handling**
   - ✅ FIXED: Added proper handling for all common message types
   - Implemented handlers for "welcome", "registration_ack", "task_result_ack", "task_state_ack", and "checkpoint_ack" messages
   - Added appropriate logging and state management for each message type
   - Eliminated warning messages about unknown message types

3. **Worker URL Format**
   - ✅ FIXED: Corrected the URL formatting in worker clients
   - Modified the `_get_ws_url` method to prevent duplicated path segments
   - Added a check to see if the URL already contains the worker endpoint pattern before appending it
   - Ensured URLs are correctly formatted for all types of coordinator URLs

### In-Progress Features

1. **Enhanced Network Disruption Simulation**
   - ⏳ Improve the network disruption mechanism to be more realistic
   - ✓ Basic simulation using process signals is working
   - ❓ Need a more realistic simulation that directly affects network connections
