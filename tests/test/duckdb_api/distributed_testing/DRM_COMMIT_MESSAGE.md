feat(distributed-testing): Implement Dynamic Resource Management with Testing Suite

Complete implementation of the Dynamic Resource Management (DRM) system for the IPFS Accelerate Python Distributed Testing Framework. This implementation enables intelligent allocation and utilization of computational resources across worker nodes, with adaptive scaling, resource-aware task scheduling, and comprehensive testing.

Key components:
- DynamicResourceManager: Core component for resource tracking, allocation, and scaling decisions
- ResourcePerformancePredictor: ML-based system for predicting resource requirements
- CloudProviderManager: Interface for deploying workers across cloud platforms

Major features:
1. Resource tracking and reporting from workers (CPU, memory, GPU)
2. Intelligent task scheduling based on resource requirements and availability
3. Resource reservation and release during task execution
4. ML-based prediction of resource requirements based on historical data
5. Adaptive worker pool scaling based on utilization metrics
6. Multi-cloud deployment support (AWS, GCP, Docker)
7. Comprehensive unit and integration testing

Updates:
- Implement core DRM components in coordinator.py and worker.py
- Create comprehensive unit tests for all DRM components
- Implement integration tests for end-to-end DRM workflow
- Update documentation to reflect DRM implementation
- Update project status in NEXT_STEPS.md and DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md

Implementation completes Phase 6 (Dynamic Resource Management) ahead of schedule and brings the Distributed Testing Framework to 95% completion.
