2. **Integration Tests**: Tests for integration with the monitoring dashboard
3. **Mock Data Tests**: Tests using simulated data to verify rendering
4. **WebSocket Tests**: Validates real-time update functionality
5. **Browser Compatibility Tests**: Verifies dashboard works in modern browsers

All tests are contained in `test_dynamic_resource_management_visualization.py` and `test_drm_dashboard_integration.py`.

## Documentation

Comprehensive documentation has been created:

1. **Module Documentation**: Detailed explanation in `DRM_VISUALIZATION_README.md`
2. **Integration Guide**: Dashboard integration documentation in `docs/DRM_DASHBOARD_INTEGRATION.md`
3. **Implementation Summary**: Technical details in `docs/DRM_VISUALIZATION_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`
4. **Example Script**: Demonstrates usage in `run_drm_visualization_example.py`

## Example Usage

The visualization system provides a simple and intuitive interface:

```python
from dynamic_resource_manager import DynamicResourceManager
from dynamic_resource_management_visualization import DRMVisualization

# Create a visualization instance
visualization = DRMVisualization(
    dynamic_resource_manager=drm,
    output_dir="./visualizations",
    interactive=True
)

# Generate visualizations
heatmap_path = visualization.create_resource_utilization_heatmap()
scaling_path = visualization.create_scaling_history_visualization()
allocation_path = visualization.create_resource_allocation_visualization()
efficiency_path = visualization.create_resource_efficiency_visualization()

# Create comprehensive dashboard
dashboard_path = visualization.create_resource_dashboard()

# Start interactive dashboard server
dashboard_url = visualization.start_dashboard_server(port=8889)
```

## Implementation Architecture

The implementation follows a modular design:

1. **DRMVisualization**: Core class that provides visualization capabilities
   - Data collection and processing
   - Visualization generation (static and interactive)
   - Dashboard server management

2. **DRMVisualizationIntegration**: Integration layer for the monitoring dashboard
   - Registry-based visualization management
   - HTML generation for dashboard embedding
   - Dashboard server control

3. **Dashboard Components**:
   - Dashboard route handler in the monitoring dashboard
   - HTML template with tabbed interface
   - JavaScript for auto-refresh and tab switching
   - WebSocket handlers for real-time updates

4. **Visualization Registry**:
   - JSON-based registry for tracking visualizations
   - Metadata storage for visualization types, paths, and timestamps
   - Persistent storage between sessions

## Key Features

1. **Real-time Monitoring**:
   - Background data collection with configurable intervals
   - WebSocket-based dashboard updates
   - Auto-refresh with configurable intervals

2. **Comprehensive Visualizations**:
   - Multiple visualization types for different aspects of resource management
   - Support for both static and interactive visualizations
   - Customizable visualization parameters

3. **Fault Tolerance**:
   - Graceful handling of missing dependencies
   - Error handling for all visualization operations
   - Fallbacks for unavailable features

4. **Performance Considerations**:
   - Configurable data retention policies
   - Background threading for data collection
   - Optimized rendering for large datasets

## Conclusion

The successful completion of the DRM Visualization system represents a significant enhancement to the Distributed Testing Framework. This component provides crucial insights into resource allocation, utilization, and scaling decisions, enabling administrators and developers to monitor and optimize the distributed testing environment effectively.

The visualization system's integration with the existing monitoring dashboard creates a unified interface for monitoring all aspects of the distributed testing environment. The combination of different visualization types provides a comprehensive view of resource management, while the real-time updates ensure that the information is always current.

The example script provides a clear demonstration of all capabilities, making it easy for users to understand and utilize the system. The thorough documentation and testing ensure the reliability and maintainability of the implementation.
