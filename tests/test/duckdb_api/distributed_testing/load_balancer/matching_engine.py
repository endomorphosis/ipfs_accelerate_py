Distributed Testing Framework - Load Balancer Matching Engine

This module implements the matching engine for the adaptive load balancing
system. It's responsible for matching tasks to optimal workers based on
requirements, capabilities, and current load.

Key features:
- Multi-factor scoring system for task-worker combinations
- Capability-based matching to ensure task requirements are satisfied
- Performance-aware matching based on historical execution data
- Load-aware distribution to maintain balanced utilization
- Specialized hardware affinity for optimal resource utilization
