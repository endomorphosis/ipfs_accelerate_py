## Technical Details

### Hardware-Aware Model Classification

The new `HardwareAwareModelClassifier` class integrates hardware and model information:

```python
classifier = HardwareAwareModelClassifier()
classification = classifier.classify_model("bert-base-uncased")

# Results include both model family and hardware recommendations
family = classification["family"]                       # embedding
recommended_hw = classification["recommended_hardware"] # cuda
template = classification["recommended_template"]       # hf_embedding_template.py
resources = classification["resource_requirements"]     # memory, cores, etc.
```

This provides a unified interface for obtaining both model family information and hardware recommendations.

### Enhanced Resource Requirements Estimation

The system now generates detailed resource requirement estimates based on model family and hardware:

```python
resource_requirements = {
    "min_memory_mb": 4000,
    "recommended_memory_mb": 8000,
    "cpu_cores": 4,
    "disk_space_mb": 500,
    "batch_size": 4
}
```

These detailed requirements help ensure models have sufficient resources for optimal performance.

### Task-Based Model Recommendations

The new `recommend_model_for_task()` method provides model recommendations for specific tasks with hardware constraints:

```python
recommendations = classifier.recommend_model_for_task(
    task="text-generation", 
    hardware_constraints=["cuda", "mps"]
)
```

This allows users to quickly find models suitable for their task and hardware environment.

### ResourcePool Configuration Generation

The system now generates optimal ResourcePool configurations for sets of models:

```python
config = classifier.get_optimal_resource_pool_config([
    "bert-base-uncased", "t5-small", "gpt2"
])
```

This configuration considers the combined resource requirements of all models to optimize resource allocation.

## Integration with ResourcePool

The ResourcePool now fully integrates with the hardware-model integration system:

```python
from resource_pool import get_global_resource_pool
from hardware_model_integration import HardwareAwareModelClassifier
from hardware_detection import CUDA, CPU

# Get hardware-aware classification
classifier = HardwareAwareModelClassifier()
classification = classifier.classify_model("bert-base-uncased")

# Create hardware preferences based on classification
hardware_preferences = {
    "priority_list": [CUDA, CPU],
    "preferred_index": 0
}

# Load model with optimal hardware configuration
pool = get_global_resource_pool()
model = pool.get_model(
    classification["family"],
    "bert-base-uncased",
    constructor=lambda: AutoModel.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased"),
    hardware_preferences=hardware_preferences
)
```

This integration ensures models are automatically loaded on the most appropriate hardware.

## Enhanced Multi-GPU Support

The enhanced hardware detection and model integration systems provide robust support for multi-GPU environments:

```python
# Distribute models across multiple GPUs based on model type
classifier = HardwareAwareModelClassifier()

# LLMs need most memory - use primary GPU
llm_classification = classifier.classify_model("gpt2")
llm_prefs = {"priority_list": [CUDA, CPU], "preferred_index": 0}

# Vision models can use secondary GPU
vision_classification = classifier.classify_model("vit-base-patch16-224")
vision_prefs = {"priority_list": [CUDA, OPENVINO, CPU], "preferred_index": 1}

# Load models with appropriate preferences
pool = get_global_resource_pool()
llm_model = pool.get_model("text_generation", "gpt2", constructor=lambda: ..., hardware_preferences=llm_prefs)
vision_model = pool.get_model("vision", "vit-base-patch16-224", constructor=lambda: ..., hardware_preferences=vision_prefs)
```

This allows efficient distribution of models across multiple GPUs based on their resource requirements.

## Command Line Interface Example

The new hardware-model integration module includes a comprehensive command-line interface:

```bash
# Classify a model with hardware awareness
python hardware_model_integration.py --model bert-base-uncased

# Get model recommendations for a task
python hardware_model_integration.py --task text-generation

# With hardware constraints
python hardware_model_integration.py --task image-classification --hw cuda mps

# Generate ResourcePool configuration
python hardware_model_integration.py --resource-config bert-base-uncased t5-small gpt2
```

This provides easy access to the hardware-aware model classification system.

## Hardware Compatibility Matrix

The system maintains a detailed hardware compatibility matrix for different model families:

| Model Family | CUDA | MPS (Apple) | ROCm | OpenVINO | WebNN | WebGPU |
|--------------|------|-------------|------|----------|-------|--------|
| Embedding (BERT, etc.) | ✅ High | ✅ High | ✅ High | ✅ High | ✅ Medium | ✅ Medium |
| Text Generation (GPT2, etc.) | ✅ High | ✅ Medium | ✅ Medium | ✅ Low | ❌ | ❌ |
| Vision (ViT, etc.) | ✅ High | ✅ High | ✅ Medium | ✅ High | ✅ Medium | ✅ Medium |
| Audio (Whisper, etc.) | ✅ High | ✅ Medium | ✅ Low | ✅ Medium | ❌ | ❌ |
| Multimodal (LLAVA, etc.) | ✅ High | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

This matrix helps guide hardware selection decisions for different model types.
