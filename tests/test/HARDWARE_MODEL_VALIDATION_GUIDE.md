# Hardware Model Validation Guide

This guide explains how to use the hardware model validation system to track test coverage and performance across different hardware platforms for all 13 key HuggingFace model types.

## Overview

The validation system consists of three main components:

1. **Comprehensive Hardware Coverage Testing** - Testing framework for executing model tests across hardware platforms
2. **Model Hardware Validation Tracker** - Database system for tracking test results, compatibility, and known issues
3. **Visualization and Reporting** - Tools for generating reports and visualizations from validation data

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Pandas, Matplotlib (for visualization)
- Git repository access
- Access to test hardware (or configured simulation for testing)

### Dependencies

The validation system relies on the following key modules:
- `test_comprehensive_hardware_coverage.py` - Core testing framework
- `model_hardware_validation_tracker.py` - Validation database system
- `benchmark_hardware_models.py` - Performance benchmarking tool
- `generate_sample_validation_data.py` - Test data generator

### Setup

1. Clone the repository (if you haven't already):
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Ensure executable permissions on scripts:
   ```bash
   chmod +x test/run_comprehensive_hardware_tests.sh
   chmod +x test/generate_sample_validation_data.py
   ```

4. Generate sample validation data (optional, for testing the system):
   ```bash
   python test/generate_sample_validation_data.py --realistic
   ```

5. Initialize the validation database:
   ```bash
   python test/model_hardware_validation_tracker.py --update-status --model bert --hardware cpu --status untested
   ```

## Running Hardware Tests

The `test_comprehensive_hardware_coverage.py` script provides a unified interface for running hardware-specific tests on the key model types.

### Running Tests for a Specific Model

```bash
python test/test_comprehensive_hardware_coverage.py --model bert
```

This will run tests for the BERT model across all compatible hardware platforms.

### Running Tests for a Specific Hardware Platform

```bash
python test/test_comprehensive_hardware_coverage.py --hardware cuda
```

This will run tests for all models compatible with the CUDA platform.

### Running Tests for a Specific Phase

```bash
python test/test_comprehensive_hardware_coverage.py --phase 1
```

This will run tests for all mock implementations that need to be replaced with real implementations (Phase 1).

### Running All Tests

```bash
./test/run_comprehensive_hardware_tests.sh
```

This will run a comprehensive test suite that executes tests in a prioritized order and generates detailed reports.

The script supports several command-line options:
```bash
# Run tests for a specific phase
./test/run_comprehensive_hardware_tests.sh --phase 1

# Run tests for a specific model
./test/run_comprehensive_hardware_tests.sh --model bert

# Run tests for a specific hardware platform
./test/run_comprehensive_hardware_tests.sh --hardware cuda
```

Each test run generates a timestamped log file in the `hardware_test_results/` directory with both summary and detailed information about test execution.

## Tracking Validation Results

The `model_hardware_validation_tracker.py` script provides a database system for tracking validation results.

### Adding Test Results

After running tests, you can add the results to the validation database:

```bash
python test/model_hardware_validation_tracker.py --add-result path/to/result.json
```

Or update a specific model-hardware status directly:

```bash
python test/model_hardware_validation_tracker.py --update-status --model bert --hardware cuda --status pass --implementation real
```

### Generating Validation Reports

To generate a comprehensive validation report:

```bash
python test/model_hardware_validation_tracker.py --generate-report
```

This will create a Markdown report with the current validation status for all model-hardware combinations.

### Creating Visualizations

To create visualizations of the validation status:

```bash
python test/model_hardware_validation_tracker.py --visualize
```

This will generate:
- A heatmap of validation status across all model-hardware combinations
- A bar chart of validation status by model category
- A pie chart of implementation types

## Benchmarking Performance

The `benchmark_hardware_models.py` script provides tools for benchmarking model performance across hardware platforms. It includes features for:

- Measuring throughput, latency, and memory usage
- Testing with multiple batch sizes
- Comparing performance across hardware platforms
- Generating formatted benchmark reports with visualizations

### Running Benchmarks for a Specific Model

```bash
python test/benchmark_hardware_models.py --model t5
```

This will benchmark the T5 model across all compatible hardware platforms.

### Running Benchmarks for a Specific Hardware Platform

```bash
python test/benchmark_hardware_models.py --hardware cuda
```

This will benchmark all compatible models on the CUDA platform.

### Running Benchmarks for a Specific Category

```bash
python test/benchmark_hardware_models.py --category vision
```

This will benchmark all vision models across compatible hardware platforms.

### Customizing Batch Sizes

```bash
python test/benchmark_hardware_models.py --model bert --batch-sizes 1,2,4,8,16
```

This will benchmark the BERT model with the specified batch sizes.

## Implementation Plan

The implementation plan for complete hardware coverage is divided into five phases:

### Phase 1: Fix Mock Implementations

Several model-hardware combinations currently use mock implementations. These need to be replaced with real implementations.

Track progress with:
```bash
python test/test_comprehensive_hardware_coverage.py --phase 1
```

### Phase 2: Expand Multimodal Support

Multimodal models (particularly LLaVA and LLaVA-Next) have limited hardware support.

Track progress with:
```bash
python test/test_comprehensive_hardware_coverage.py --phase 2
```

### Phase 3: Web Platform Extension

Improve WebNN and WebGPU support for more model types, particularly audio and video models.

Track progress with:
```bash
python test/test_comprehensive_hardware_coverage.py --phase 3
```

### Phase 4: Comprehensive Benchmarking

Standardize performance metrics across all model-hardware combinations.

Track progress with:
```bash
python test/benchmark_hardware_models.py --all
```

### Phase 5: Edge Case Handling

Improve reliability for edge cases and document workarounds.

## Best Practices

### Adding New Models

When adding a new model to the validation system:

1. Add the model to `KEY_MODELS` in `test_comprehensive_hardware_coverage.py`
2. Create test implementations for compatible hardware platforms
3. Update the validation database with initial status
4. Run benchmarks to establish baseline performance

### Adding New Hardware Platforms

When adding a new hardware platform to the validation system:

1. Add the platform to `HARDWARE_PLATFORMS` in `test_comprehensive_hardware_coverage.py`
2. Define compatibility with existing models
3. Implement test runners for the platform
4. Update the validation database with initial status

### Reporting Issues

When discovering issues with model-hardware combinations:

1. Add the issue to the validation database:
   ```bash
   python test/model_hardware_validation_tracker.py --update-status --model <model> --hardware <hardware> --status fail --notes "Description of the issue"
   ```

2. Create a detailed issue in the issue tracker with:
   - Model and hardware details
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected behavior
   - Actual behavior
   - Workaround (if known)

## Continuous Integration

The validation system is designed to work with continuous integration pipelines:

1. **Nightly Runs**: Schedule nightly runs of `run_comprehensive_hardware_tests.sh`
2. **Pull Request Validation**: Run targeted tests for affected models and hardware platforms
3. **Weekly Reports**: Generate weekly validation reports and visualizations
