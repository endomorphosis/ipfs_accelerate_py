   - Added real-time monitoring setup with configurable metrics and alert thresholds
   - Added robust error handling and fallback mechanisms

2. **Testing**
   - Created comprehensive test suite in `test_visualization_db_connector.py`
   - Implemented mock testing for dashboard API interactions
   - Added standalone test script with simplified implementation for dependency-free testing
   - Created demo script showcasing key dashboard integration features
   - Performed manual validation of dashboard integration functionality

   - Session token management with automatic renewal
   - Connection state tracking and recovery

2. **Visualization Upload**
   - Direct upload of visualizations to the dashboard
   - Support for various visualization types
   - Configurable refresh intervals for real-time updates

3. **Dashboard Panel Creation**
   - Creation of individual panels with data from the database
   - Support for different panel types (MAPE comparison, heatmap, time series, etc.)
   - Customizable layout and sizing

4. **Comprehensive Dashboard Generation**
   - Creation of complete dashboards with multiple panels
   - Optimized panel layout based on visualization type
   - Configurable panel inclusion and arrangement

5. **Real-Time Monitoring**
   - Configuration of metrics to monitor
   - Customizable alert thresholds for each metric
   - Automatic dashboard panel creation for monitored metrics
   - Scheduled checks with configurable intervals

## Technical Implementation

The dashboard integration uses a client-server architecture:

1. **Client-Side Implementation**
   - `ValidationVisualizerDBConnector` serves as the client interface
   - Authentication and session management
   - Data retrieval and transformation for visualization
   - Dashboard API interaction

2. **Server-Side Interaction**
   - REST API communication with the dashboard server
   - JSON-based data exchange
   - Authentication and authorization handling
   - Visualization rendering and updating

3. **Real-Time Monitoring**
   - Scheduled checks with configurable intervals
   - Alert threshold configuration
   - Real-time dashboard updates

## Testing Results

The dashboard integration has been thoroughly tested:

1. **Unit Tests**
   - All methods tested individually with mock dependencies
   - Edge cases covered (connection failure, authentication errors, etc.)
   - Parameter validation tested

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Complete workflow testing from data retrieval to dashboard creation
   - Panel creation and configuration testing
   - Comprehensive dashboard generation testing

3. **Demo Script**
   - Created `demo_monitoring_dashboard.py` showcasing key features
   - All features demonstrated with sample data
   - Successfully executed in test environment

All tests pass successfully, confirming that the implementation meets the requirements and works as expected.

## Next Steps

While the monitoring dashboard integration is now complete, several enhancements could be considered for future work:

1. **Enhanced Visualization Types**
   - Add support for additional visualization types
   - Implement custom visualization layouts
   - Create interactive visualization filters

2. **Advanced Alerting**
   - Implement more sophisticated alert conditions
   - Add support for alert notifications (email, Slack, etc.)
   - Create alert history tracking

3. **Dashboard Customization**
   - Add support for user-defined dashboard layouts
   - Implement dashboard sharing and collaboration
   - Create dashboard templates for common scenarios

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement data caching for faster dashboard updates
   - Add incremental updates to reduce data transfer
   - Optimize visualization rendering for large datasets

## Conclusion

The monitoring dashboard integration for the Simulation Accuracy and Validation Framework is now complete and ready for use. This integration significantly enhances the framework's capabilities by providing real-time visualization and monitoring of simulation validation results.

The implementation meets all requirements and provides a solid foundation for future enhancements. Users can now easily create comprehensive dashboards and set up real-time monitoring for simulation accuracy, enabling better insights and faster detection of simulation drift.
