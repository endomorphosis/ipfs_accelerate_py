### What is MAPE?

Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) measures the average percentage difference between simulated and actual values. Lower values indicate better simulation accuracy.

- **Excellent (< 5%):** Simulation is highly accurate
- **Good (5-10%):** Simulation is very reliable
- **Acceptable (10-15%):** Simulation is usable but could be improved
- **Problematic (15-25%):** Simulation needs calibration
- **Poor (> 25%):** Simulation requires significant improvement
