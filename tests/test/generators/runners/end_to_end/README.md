# End-to-End Testing Framework

## Overview

The End-to-End Testing Framework is a comprehensive solution for testing model implementations across different hardware platforms. Rather than testing individual components separately, this framework focuses on:

1. Generating all components (skill, test, benchmark) together
2. Testing components as a unified whole
3. Comparing results against expected outputs
4. Generating comprehensive documentation
5. Tracking simulation vs. real hardware execution
6. Storing comprehensive test results in DuckDB database

This approach ensures that models work correctly across the entire pipeline and helps identify issues at the generator level rather than in individual files.

## Component Testing Frameworks

### Unified Component Tester

The **Unified Component Tester** is our latest enhanced implementation that provides a complete solution for generating and testing model components across different hardware platforms. It builds on the integrated component tester with:

1. **Complete Component Integration**: Generates, tests, and evaluates all components together as a cohesive unit
2. **Enhanced Result Organization**: Creates robust expected/collected results structure with historical tracking
3. **Advanced Documentation Generation**: Produces detailed markdown documentation with model-family and hardware-specific content
4. **Comprehensive Testing**: Validates components across all model families and hardware platforms
5. **Template-Driven Development**: Uses a robust template system for maintenance efficiency
6. **Parallel Execution**: Supports multi-worker execution for faster testing
7. **Database Integration**: Stores results in DuckDB with simulation status tracking

```bash
# Test a model with the unified component tester
python unified_component_tester.py --model bert-base-uncased --hardware cpu

# Run a comprehensive test across model families
python unified_component_tester.py --model-family text-embedding --hardware cpu,cuda

# Run tests in parallel with documentation
python unified_component_tester.py --all-models --priority-hardware --max-workers 4 --generate-docs
```

## Workflow

1. **Test Execution**:
   - The framework detects available hardware platforms and tracks simulation status
   - It generates skill, test, and benchmark files based on templates
   - It runs tests with real hardware or in simulation mode and collects results
   - It compares results with expected results using advanced validation
   - It generates comprehensive documentation if requested
   - It stores results in both file system and DuckDB database

2. **Result Management**:
   - Expected results are stored in the `expected_results` directory
   - Actual results are stored in timestamped directories under `collected_results`
   - Rich metadata is captured including environment, platform, and git information
   - Performance metrics are tracked for trend analysis
   - Summary reports are generated for each test run
   - Test results are stored in DuckDB database with simulation status tracking

3. **Distributed Execution**:
   - Tests can be distributed across multiple worker threads
   - Tasks are allocated efficiently to maximize resource utilization
   - Results are aggregated into a single comprehensive report
   - Each worker handles a subset of the model/hardware combinations

4. **Database Integration**:
   - Test results are stored in DuckDB database with rich metadata
   - SQL queries can be used to analyze test results trends
   - Performance metrics are tracked over time for regression detection
   - Simulation status is tracked to distinguish between real and simulated tests

5. **Maintenance**:
   - When models or hardware change, update expected results
   - Fix issues in the generators rather than in individual files
   - Clean up old test results periodically
   - Monitor database size and performance

## Adding New Models or Hardware

To add a new model or hardware platform to the testing framework:

1. Update the `MODEL_FAMILY_MAP` in `run_e2e_tests.py` to include the new model
2. Update the `SUPPORTED_HARDWARE` list to include the new hardware platform
3. Run tests with the `--update-expected` flag to generate expected results
4. Run tests normally to verify the implementation works correctly

## Best Practices

1. **Always update expected results after significant changes**:
   ```bash
   python run_e2e_tests.py --model your-model --hardware your-hardware --update-expected
   ```

2. **Generate documentation to understand implementation**:
   ```bash
   python run_e2e_tests.py --model your-model --hardware your-hardware --generate-docs
   ```

3. **Clean up old results periodically**:
   ```bash
   python run_e2e_tests.py --clean-old-results --days 14
   ```

4. **Focus fixes on generators rather than individual files**

## Integration with CI/CD

This framework is fully integrated with CI/CD pipelines to:

1. Test all models and hardware platforms automatically
2. Update expected results when approved by reviewers
3. Generate documentation as part of the build process
4. Alert on test failures or regressions
5. Track performance metrics over time
6. Store results in the database with CI metadata
7. Generate badges and reports for pull requests

   - Check if hardware is being simulated when it shouldn't be

2. **Documentation is not generating correctly**:
   - Check that all components are being generated correctly
   - Verify the model and hardware names are correct
   - Examine the template_validation.py logs for errors
   - Ensure the ModelDocGenerator has access to the required files

3. **Database integration issues**:
   - Verify the DuckDB installation with: `pip install duckdb==0.9.2`
   - Check database path permissions: `--db-path ./benchmark_db.duckdb`
   - Examine the db_error.log files in the results directory
   - Try using `--no-db` to disable database integration temporarily

4. **Visualization Dashboard and Integrated Reports System issues**:
   - Consult the comprehensive [TROUBLESHOOTING_GUIDE.md](./TROUBLESHOOTING_GUIDE.md) for detailed solutions to:
