# bert-base-uncased Implementation Guide for cpu

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of bert-base-uncased on cpu hardware.

## Skill Implementation

The skill implementation is responsible for loading and running the model on cpu.

```python
# Include key parts of the skill implementation
```

## Test Implementation

The test ensures that the model produces correct outputs.

```python
# Include key parts of the test implementation
```

## Benchmark Implementation

The benchmark measures the performance of the model on cpu.

```python
# Include key parts of the benchmark implementation
```

## Expected Results

The model should produce the following outputs for the given inputs:

```json
# Include examples of expected inputs and outputs
```

## Performance Characteristics

- **Latency**: Expected latency on cpu is ~10-15ms
- **Throughput**: Expected throughput is ~80 inferences/second
- **Memory**: Expected memory usage is ~512MB

## Implementation Notes

- This model uses XYZ architecture
- On cpu, the best performance is achieved with batch size 8
- Implementation based on HuggingFace Transformers library
