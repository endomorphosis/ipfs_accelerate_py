# Expected Results Directory

This directory contains expected results from model inference tests that serve as the "golden set" for regression testing. These are verified, correct outputs that will be compared against actual results from the `collected_results` directory.

## Directory Structure

Results are organized by model type and hardware combination:

```
expected_results/
├── bert/
│   ├── cpu/
│   ├── cuda/
│   ├── webgpu/
│   └── ...
├── vit/
│   ├── cpu/
│   ├── cuda/
│   ├── webgpu/
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

## File Format

Each result file contains:
- Input data used for the test
- Expected output tensor(s)
- Expected performance metrics (latency, throughput)
- Expected memory usage
- Hardware specific details used for the test

## Usage

The files in this directory should not be modified manually. They are generated by the end-to-end testing framework when a test is validated and approved as a reference implementation.

To update expected results after model or hardware changes:
```bash
python generators/runners/end_to_end/run_e2e_tests.py --model bert --hardware cuda --update-expected
```

## Validation Process

All expected results undergo a thorough validation process before being added to this directory:
1. Cross-verification on multiple hardware configurations
2. Comparison with reference implementations where available
3. Review of outputs for correctness
4. Testing against known input/output pairs

This ensures that our expected results represent the correct behavior of models across different hardware platforms.
