1. **Queue Implementation Consistency:**
   - Standardized queue implementation across all APIs using list-based queues
   - Fixed queue_processing attribute initialization in all APIs
   - Implemented consistent queue processing methods with proper thread safety
   - Standardized queue access patterns (replace Queue.get() with list.pop(0))

2. **Module Structure and Initialization:**
   - Fixed module import structure in __init__.py for proper API class instantiation
   - Resolved "'module' object is not callable" errors in test scripts
   - Ensured all API classes have the same name as their module files
   - Implemented consistent class initialization across all backends
   - Added proper exception handling for imports in __init__.py

3. **Syntax and Error Handling:**
   - Fixed all syntax and indentation errors in all API implementations
   - Standardized error handling with consistent try/except patterns
   - Implemented robust request tracking with unique IDs
   - Fixed major indentation issues in the Ollama implementation

4. **Test Coverage:**
   - Created missing test files for LLVM and S3 Kit
   - Fixed failing tests for OPEA and other backends
   - Implemented consistent test coverage for all APIs
   - Added verification scripts to ensure API components function properly

### Advanced Features Implemented:
1. **Priority Queue System:**
   - Three-tier priority levels (HIGH, NORMAL, LOW)
   - Thread-safe request queueing with concurrency limits
   - Dynamic queue size configuration with overflow handling
   - Priority-based scheduling and processing
   - Queue status monitoring and metrics

2. **Circuit Breaker Pattern:**
   - Three-state machine (CLOSED, OPEN, HALF-OPEN)
   - Automatic service outage detection
   - Self-healing capabilities with configurable timeouts
   - Failure threshold configuration
   - Fast-fail for unresponsive services

3. **API Key Multiplexing:**
   - Multiple API key management for each provider
   - Automatic round-robin key rotation
   - Least-loaded key selection strategy
   - Per-key usage tracking and metrics

4. **Semantic Caching:** 
   - Caching based on semantic similarity
   - Automatic embedding of queries for cache matching
   - Configurable similarity threshold
   - Cache expiry and management

5. **Request Batching:**
   - Automatic request combining for compatible models
   - Configurable batch size and timeout
   - Model-specific batching strategies
   - Batch queue management

### Implementation Details by API:

#### Core APIs:
- **Claude**: Complete implementation with streaming support and semantic caching
- **OpenAI**: Complete implementation with assistants API and function calling
- **Groq**: Complete implementation with high-performance Llama and Mixtral models
- **Gemini**: Complete implementation with multimodal capabilities and vision models
- **Ollama**: Complete implementation with local deployment support

#### Specialized APIs:
- **HF TGI/TEI**: Complete implementations with direct Hugging Face integration
- **LLVM**: Complete implementation for optimized local inference
- **OVMS**: Complete implementation for OpenVINO Model Server
- **OPEA**: Complete implementation for enterprise AI platform integration
- **S3 Kit**: Complete implementation for model storage and retrieval with support for multiple endpoint handlers, each with its own API credentials, circuit breaker, and backoff configuration. Advanced endpoint multiplexing allowing concurrent connections to different S3-compatible providers (AWS S3, MinIO, Ceph) with round-robin and least-loaded routing strategies.

### Statistics:
- **Total Python APIs**: 11
- **Total TypeScript APIs**: 18
- **Complete Implementations**: 100%
- **Advanced Features**: Python: 5 per API, TypeScript: 7+ per API
