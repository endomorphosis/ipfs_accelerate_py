# Advanced Browser Recovery Strategies

**Implementation Date:** March 21, 2025  
**Latest Update:** March 16, 2025

## Overview

The Advanced Browser Recovery Strategies module extends our distributed testing framework's fault tolerance capabilities with sophisticated, model-aware recovery strategies for browser automation. This system enhances the Circuit Breaker pattern with progressive recovery techniques that can automatically recover from various browser failure scenarios while optimizing for different model types and browser strengths.

## Key Features

- **Browser-Specific Recovery**: Tailored recovery strategies for Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari
- **Model-Aware Optimization**: Specialized recovery approaches for text, vision, audio, and multimodal models
- **Progressive Recovery**: Escalating intervention levels from simple retries to simulation fallback
- **Performance Tracking**: Detailed metrics on recovery strategy effectiveness
- **Circuit Breaker Integration**: Seamless integration with circuit breaker pattern for comprehensive fault tolerance
- **Extensible Architecture**: Easily add new strategies or customize existing ones
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Complete unit test coverage for all recovery strategies
- **Enhanced Metrics Tracking**: Recovery history, success rates, and performance analytics

## Recovery Strategy Hierarchy

The system implements a progressive hierarchy of recovery strategies with increasing levels of intervention:

1. **Simple Retry (Level 1 - MINIMAL)**: Retry operation without restarting browser
2. **Browser Restart (Level 2 - MODERATE)**: Restart browser with same settings
3. **Settings Adjustment (Level 3 - AGGRESSIVE)**: Restart browser with optimized settings
   - Browser-specific adjustments (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
   - Model-specific adjustments (Text, Vision, Audio, Multimodal)
4. **Browser Fallback (Level 4 - FALLBACK)**: Switch to different browser optimized for model type
5. **Simulation Fallback (Level 5 - SIMULATION)**: Fall back to simulation mode as last resort

The system intelligently selects the appropriate starting level based on failure type, with resource-related failures starting at more aggressive levels while connection issues may start with simple retries.

## Model-Aware Optimizations

Each recovery strategy includes optimizations specific to different model types:

from distributed_testing.circuit_breaker import CircuitBreaker, CircuitState, CircuitOpenError

# Create circuit breaker with enhanced metrics
circuit = CircuitBreaker(
    name="browser_firefox_whisper",
    failure_threshold=3,
    recovery_timeout=10.0,
    half_open_max_calls=1,
    success_threshold=2

        result = await circuit.execute(run_browser_operation)
        return result
    except CircuitOpenError:
        # Circuit is open, operation not attempted
        return {"success": False, "error": "Circuit open"}
    except Exception as e:
        # Attempt recovery
        recovered = await recover_browser(bridge, e, {

            try:
                result = await run_browser_operation()
                # Add recovery information
                if isinstance(result, dict):
                    result["recovered"] = True
                    result["recovery_method"] = "settings_adjustment_audio" # Example

### Recovery Strategy Performance Analysis

```python
# Get recovery performance statistics
recovery_manager = ProgressiveRecoveryManager()
stats = recovery_manager.get_strategy_stats()

# Analyze performance to find best strategies
analysis = recovery_manager.analyze_performance()

# Get best strategy for each browser/model combination
best_strategies = analysis["best_strategies"]

# Print best strategy for Firefox and audio models
print(f"Best strategy for Firefox/Audio: {best_strategies['firefox']['audio']['strategy']}")

# Get time-series performance data
time_series = analysis["time_series"]
```

print(f"Circuit Name:      {circuit.name}")
print(f"Current State:     {metrics['current_state']}")
print(f"Executions:        {metrics['executions']}")
print(f"Successes:         {metrics['successes']}")
print(f"Failures:          {metrics['failures']}")
print(f"Success Rate:      {metrics['success_rate']:.2%}")
print(f"Recoveries:        {metrics['recoveries']}")
print(f"Recovery Rate:     {metrics['recovery_rate']:.2%}")

# If circuit has opened
if metrics['circuit_open_count'] > 0:
    print(f"Circuit Opens:     {metrics['circuit_open_count']}")
    print(f"Avg Downtime:      {metrics['avg_downtime_seconds']:.2f}s")

# Show recent recovery history
recovery_history = metrics['recovery_history']
if recovery_history:
    print("Recent Recoveries:")
    for i, recovery in enumerate(recovery_history[-3:]):  # Show last 3 recoveries
        print(f"  {i+1}. {recovery['timestamp']} - {recovery['recovery_method']} ({recovery['browser']})")
```
