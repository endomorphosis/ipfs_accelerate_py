# HuggingFace Model Lookup and Registry

This document explains how to use the enhanced model lookup features to find appropriate models for your tests and ensure they are correct and accessible.

## Overview

The `find_models.py` script provides several features to help you find and verify HuggingFace models:

1. **Model Discovery**: Find popular models for a specific model type
2. **API Integration**: Query the HuggingFace API to find the most downloaded models
3. **Model Verification**: Verify that a model exists and is accessible
4. **Registry Management**: Maintain a registry of default models for each model type
5. **Smart Model Selection**: Automatically select smaller, more suitable models for testing

## Usage Examples

### Find Popular Models for a Type

To find popular models for a specific model type (e.g., "bert"), use:

```bash
python find_models.py --model-type bert
```

This will query the HuggingFace API and display the most downloaded models of that type, along with a recommended default model.

### Verify a Specific Model

To verify that a specific model exists and is accessible:

```bash
python find_models.py --verify "bert-base-uncased"
```

### Update the Model Registry

To update the registry with the latest information from HuggingFace:

```bash
python find_models.py --update-registry
```

This will create or update the `huggingface_model_types.json` file with the latest model information.

### Query and Update a Specific Model Type

To query a specific model type and update its entry in the registry:

```bash
python find_models.py --model-type whisper --update-registry
```

### Find All Models

To discover all available model types in the transformers library:

```bash
python find_models.py
```

### Focus on Hyphenated Models

To find models with hyphenated names (which need special handling):

```bash
python find_models.py --hyphenated-only
```

## Smart Model Selection

The script will automatically recommend suitable default models based on several criteria:

1. **Popularity**: Models with more downloads are preferred
2. **Size**: Smaller models are preferred when available
   - Models with "base" or "small" in their name are prioritized
3. **Accessibility**: Only models that are publicly accessible are considered

## Registry File

The model registry is stored in `huggingface_model_types.json` and contains:

```json
{
  "bert": {
    "default_model": "bert-base-uncased",
    "models": ["bert-base-uncased", "bert-large-uncased", "..."],
    "downloads": {
      "bert-base-uncased": 10000000,
      "bert-large-uncased": 5000000
    },
    "updated_at": "2025-03-20T12:34:56.789Z"
  },
  "gpt2": {
    "default_model": "gpt2",
    "models": ["gpt2", "gpt2-medium", "..."],
    "downloads": {
      "gpt2": 15000000,
      "gpt2-medium": 7500000
    },
    "updated_at": "2025-03-20T12:34:56.789Z"
  },
  // ...
}
```

## Integrating with Test Generator

The test generator has been enhanced with direct integration to use the model lookup system for dynamic model selection:

```python
# Full integration with the test generator
python integrate_model_lookup.py --update-all

# Integration with a specific model update
python integrate_model_lookup.py --model gpt2

# Integration only (no registry updates)
python integrate_model_lookup.py
```

The test generator now uses a sophisticated approach to select the most appropriate models:

```python
def get_model_from_registry(model_type):
    """Get the best default model for a model type, using dynamic lookup if available."""
    if HAS_MODEL_LOOKUP:
        # Try to get a recommended model from the HuggingFace API
        try:
            default_model = get_recommended_default_model(model_type)
            logger.info(f"Using recommended model for {model_type}: {default_model}")
            return default_model
        except Exception as e:
            logger.warning(f"Error getting recommended model for {model_type}: {e}")
            # Fall back to registry lookup
    
    # Use the static registry as fallback
    if model_type in MODEL_REGISTRY:
        return MODEL_REGISTRY[model_type].get("default_model")
    
    # For unknown models, use a heuristic approach
    return f"{model_type}-base" if "-base" not in model_type else model_type
```

This implementation provides:

1. **Dynamic Lookup**: When available, uses the HuggingFace API to find the best model
2. **Registry Fallback**: If API lookup fails, falls back to the stored registry data
3. **Static Fallback**: If the model is not in the registry, uses a heuristic approach
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Works even if dependencies or network access are unavailable

## Handling Hyphenated Models

Special handling is included for hyphenated model names (e.g., "gpt-j", "xlm-roberta"), which are normalized to valid Python identifiers and mapped to the correct class names.

## Debugging Issues

If you encounter model loading errors:

1. Verify the model exists using `--verify`
2. Try a different model of the same type with `--model-type`
3. Check the model registry with `cat huggingface_model_types.json`
4. Update the registry with `--update-registry`

## CI/CD Considerations

In CI/CD environments, API access might be restricted or unreliable. The system accounts for this with:

1. **Fallback Mechanism**: If API access fails, falls back to the registry or default patterns
2. **Registry Caching**: Uses the previously saved registry without requiring API access
3. **Dry Run Mode**: Supports a `--dry-run` flag to preview changes without applying them
4. **Environment Variables**: Can be configured to skip API calls in specific environments:
   ```bash
   # Force use of the registry without API calls
   export HF_API_DISABLED=1
   python integrate_model_lookup.py
   ```

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Registry Updates**: Update the registry periodically (weekly) to keep model recommendations current
2. **Pre-Commit Updates**: Update the registry before major test generation sessions
3. **Version Control**: Commit the registry file to maintain a history of model changes
4. **CI/CD Integration**: Set up a recurring job to update the registry automatically
5. **Verification**: Before large test runs, verify critical models with the `--verify` flag
