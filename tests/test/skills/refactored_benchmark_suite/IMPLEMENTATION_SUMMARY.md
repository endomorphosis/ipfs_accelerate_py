## Example Usage

```python
# Run hardware-aware benchmark for multimodal models
from refactored_benchmark_suite.examples import multimodal_hardware_aware_benchmark

# Benchmark multiple modern multimodal models with hardware optimizations
results = multimodal_hardware_aware_benchmark.benchmark_modern_multimodal_models(
    use_power_metrics=True,
    use_bandwidth_metrics=True,
    model_size="base",
    output_dir="multimodal_benchmark_results"
)

# Or benchmark a specific multimodal model
single_results = multimodal_hardware_aware_benchmark.benchmark_specific_multimodal_model(
    model_id="llava-hf/llava-1.5-7b-hf",
    use_hardware_metrics=True
