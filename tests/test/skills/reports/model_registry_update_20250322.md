# Model Registry Update Report (March 22, 2025)

## Summary

Today we added and implemented several high-priority models to the HuggingFace model test suite:

- Added 11 new models to the MODEL_REGISTRY in test_generator_fixed.py
- Successfully implemented 3 of these models with complete test files
- Updated architecture type mappings to include the new models
- Updated the HF_MODEL_COVERAGE_ROADMAP.md to reflect our progress

## Test Implementation Details

### Qwen2 and Qwen3 Implementation 

The test implementations for Qwen2 and Qwen3 include:

- Complete test class with hardware detection (CUDA, MPS, CPU)
- Test methods for pipeline API, direct model inference, and multiple prompts
- OpenVINO integration placeholders for future hardware acceleration
- Comprehensive model registry with parameter details
- Hardware compatibility testing across platforms

### BLIP-2 Implementation

The BLIP-2 implementation includes:

- Complete test class with hardware detection
- Test methods for image-to-text generation, image-text similarity, and visual QA
- Support for processing images with colored shapes for testing
- Comprehensive model registry with parameter details
- Testing with multiple prompt and question types

## Progress Update

- Total tracked models: 198
- Previously implemented: 139 models (70.2%)
- New implementations: 3 models
- Current implementation: 142 models (71.7%)
- Remaining models: 56 models (28.3%)

## Next Steps

1. Implement tests for the remaining registry-only models
2. Focus on high-visibility multimodal models (Fuyu, Kosmos-2)
3. Update the CI/CD pipeline to include new tests
4. Begin implementing medium-priority models

## Technical Notes

- The model registry now follows a consistent pattern for all model types
- Architecture type definitions have been updated to include all new model types
- Fixed issues with hyphenated model names (like "blip-2") to ensure proper test file generation
- Created a reusable test structure that can be applied to similar model architectures
