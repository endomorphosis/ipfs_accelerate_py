# Full HuggingFace Model Coverage Project

## Overview

This project implements comprehensive test coverage for all HuggingFace model types in the IPFS Accelerate Python framework. The goal is to ensure that all 300+ model architectures have proper test coverage with syntactically correct test files.

## Key Components

1. **create_coverage_tool.py**: The main tool for generating, validating, and tracking model test coverage
2. **MODEL_COVERAGE_TOOL_GUIDE.md**: Detailed documentation on using the coverage tool
3. **IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md**: Summary of the implementation approach and achievements
4. **MODEL_TEST_COVERAGE.md**: Auto-generated report on current test coverage status
5. **HF_MODEL_COVERAGE_ROADMAP.md**: Roadmap for achieving 100% model coverage

## Current Status

As of March 21, 2025:
- 119 model types have test coverage
- Tests are syntactically correct and properly handle hyphenated model names
- Coverage spans all major architecture categories (encoder-only, decoder-only, encoder-decoder, vision, speech, multimodal)

## Features

The implementation includes several key innovations:

1. **Token-based Replacement System**: Preserves code structure during template generation
2. **Hyphenated Model Name Handling**: Properly converts names like `xlm-roberta` to valid Python identifiers
3. **Batch Generation**: Efficiently generates tests for multiple models
4. **Coverage Tracking**: Automatically generates reports on test coverage
5. **Syntax Validation**: Ensures all generated tests are syntactically correct

## Getting Started

To use the model coverage tool:

```bash
# Generate a test for a specific model
python create_coverage_tool.py --generate bert

# Generate tests for models that don't have tests yet
python create_coverage_tool.py --batch 10

# List models without tests
python create_coverage_tool.py --list-missing

# Update the coverage report
python create_coverage_tool.py --update-report
```

- [Model Coverage Tool Guide](MODEL_COVERAGE_TOOL_GUIDE.md): Detailed usage instructions
- [Implementation Summary](IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md): Technical details of the implementation
- [Model Coverage Roadmap](HF_MODEL_COVERAGE_ROADMAP.md): Plan for achieving 100% coverage

## Future Work

The current roadmap includes:
1. Completing tests for all 300+ model architectures
2. Adding more sophisticated test cases for each architecture
3. Integrating performance benchmarking
4. Enhancing hardware-specific testing
5. Implementing CI/CD integration for automatic test generation

## Contributing

To contribute to the model coverage project:
1. Add new model types to the `ARCHITECTURE_TYPES` dictionary
2. Create optimized templates for specific architectures
3. Enhance the token-based replacement system
4. Add more sophisticated test cases
