## DuckDB Integration

The system integrates with DuckDB for structured storage and analysis:

### Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE hardware_results (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    model_id VARCHAR,
    model_type VARCHAR,
    hardware VARCHAR,
    success BOOLEAN,
    load_time DOUBLE,
    inference_time DOUBLE,
    memory_usage DOUBLE,
    error VARCHAR,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP,
    output_shape VARCHAR
)

CREATE TABLE hardware_detection (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    hardware_type VARCHAR,
    available BOOLEAN,
    name VARCHAR,
    features VARCHAR,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP
)
```

### Query Examples

```sql
-- Get average inference time by hardware platform
SELECT hardware, AVG(inference_time) as avg_time
FROM hardware_results
WHERE success = TRUE
GROUP BY hardware
ORDER BY avg_time ASC;

-- Find optimal hardware for each model type
SELECT model_type, hardware, AVG(inference_time) as avg_time
FROM hardware_results
WHERE success = TRUE
GROUP BY model_type, hardware
ORDER BY model_type, avg_time ASC;

-- Track memory usage patterns
SELECT model_id, hardware, memory_usage
FROM hardware_results
WHERE success = TRUE
ORDER BY memory_usage DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

## Hardware Fallback Mechanism

The system implements graceful fallback when preferred hardware is unavailable:

1. **Priority-based Fallback**:
   - CUDA/MPS → OpenVINO → CPU
   - WebGPU → WebNN → CPU
   - Maintains functional testing with degraded performance

2. **Transparent Reporting**:
   - Clearly indicates when fallback occurs
   - Reports expected vs. actual hardware
   - Quantifies performance impact of fallback

3. **Adaptive Testing**:
   - Adjusts batch sizes based on available hardware
   - Modifies test parameters for compatibility
   - Ensures tests complete successfully even with limited resources

## Integration with Distributed Testing

The hardware compatibility testing system integrates with the distributed testing framework:

1. **Hardware-aware Task Distribution**:
   - Assigns tasks based on available hardware
   - Optimizes worker assignments for hardware capabilities
   - Balances load across available resources

2. **Comprehensive Result Aggregation**:
   - Collects results from distributed workers
   - Aggregates performance metrics by hardware platform
   - Generates unified compatibility matrix

3. **Fault Tolerance**:
   - Handles hardware-specific failures gracefully
   - Implements automatic retries with fallback hardware
   - Reports detailed error information for troubleshooting

## Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements for the hardware compatibility testing system:
