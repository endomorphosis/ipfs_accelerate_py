# Staged Test Refactoring Approach

## Overview

This document outlines our staged approach to test refactoring, which aims to modernize and standardize our test suite while minimizing disruption to the existing development workflow. We will implement changes in a parallel `refactored_test_suite` directory, allowing teams to gradually adopt the new test structure at their own pace.

## Staged Implementation

### 1. Parallel Development

We will maintain two test structures simultaneously:
- The existing test files remain in their current locations
- Refactored tests are placed in the new `refactored_test_suite` directory

This approach ensures:
- Existing CI/CD pipelines continue to function
- Current developers can work without disruption
- Teams can gradually adopt the new test structure
- We can validate the new approach before fully committing

### 2. Refactored Test Suite Structure

The new test structure follows a logical organization pattern:

```
refactored_test_suite/
├── unit/              # Unit tests for components
├── integration/       # Integration tests between components
├── models/            # ML model tests
│   ├── text/
│   ├── vision/
│   └── audio/
├── hardware/          # Hardware compatibility tests
│   ├── webgpu/
│   ├── webnn/
│   └── platform/
├── browser/           # Browser-specific tests
├── api/               # API tests
└── e2e/               # End-to-end tests
```

### 3. Migration Path

The migration process follows these steps:

1. **Setup Phase**
   - Create the `refactored_test_suite` directory
   - Implement base test classes and utilities
   - Configure CI to run both test suites

2. **Migration Phase**
   - Start with high-priority test categories
   - Create refactored versions in the new directory
   - Run both original and refactored tests in CI

3. **Validation Phase**
   - Ensure refactored tests provide equivalent coverage
   - Verify performance improvements
   - Address any issues discovered

4. **Transition Phase**
   - Gradually promote the new structure to teams
   - Train developers on the new patterns
   - Begin using the new structure for new tests

5. **Completion Phase**
   - Once all teams have transitioned, deprecate old tests
   - Make the refactored structure the standard

## Using the Utilities

The `test_refactoring_utils.py` script provides tools to assist with the test refactoring process:

### 1. Generate Directory Structure

```bash
# Create the basic refactored test structure
./test_refactoring_utils.py structure
```

### 2. Generate Base Classes

```bash
# Generate base test classes
./test_refactoring_utils.py base-classes
```

### 3. Generate Migration Plan

```bash
# Analyze existing tests and create a migration plan
./test_refactoring_utils.py plan --ast-report test_analysis_20250321/test_ast_report.json --output refactored_test_suite/migration_plan.json
```

### 4. Generate Migration Report

```bash
# Generate a report on the current status of the migration
./test_refactoring_utils.py report --ast-report test_analysis_20250321/test_ast_report.json --output refactored_test_suite/migration_report.json
```

## Benefits of Staged Approach

- **Risk Reduction**: Issues can be identified and addressed without impacting existing workflows
- **Incremental Adoption**: Teams can migrate at their own pace
- **Continuous Integration**: Both test suites can run simultaneously in CI
- **Validation**: Refactored tests can be thoroughly validated before full adoption
- **Developer Comfort**: Developers have time to learn and adapt to the new patterns

## Timeline

The staged approach will follow this timeline:

- **Weeks 1-2**: Setup phase (infrastructure, base classes, tools)
- **Weeks 3-5**: Migration of high-priority tests
- **Weeks 6-7**: Validation and documentation
- **Week 8**: Assessment and planning for full transition
- **Ongoing**: Gradual adoption by teams at their own pace

## Monitoring and Reporting

We will track the progress of the test refactoring using:

1. Test coverage metrics for both original and refactored tests
2. Test execution time comparisons
3. Number of tests migrated vs. remaining
4. Issues discovered during the refactoring process

Regular status reports will be provided to keep all teams informed of progress and any challenges encountered.
