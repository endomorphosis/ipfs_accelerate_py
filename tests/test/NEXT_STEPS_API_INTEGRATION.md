## Medium-Term Priorities (Next 4-6 Weeks)

### 4. Integration Testing and Validation

- **Test Coverage**
  - [ ] Develop comprehensive integration tests for all API endpoints
  - [ ] Add tests for error conditions and edge cases
  - [ ] Implement performance and load testing

- **End-to-End Workflows**
  - [ ] Create additional end-to-end workflow examples
  - [ ] Test cross-component workflows with real-world scenarios
  - [ ] Validate WebSocket behavior under various conditions

### 5. Dashboard and Visualization

- **Unified Dashboard**
  - [ ] Create a unified web dashboard for all components
  - [ ] Add real-time status visualization for active operations
  - [ ] Implement historical data visualization and reporting

- **Monitoring Integration**
  - [ ] Add Prometheus metrics endpoints for all APIs
  - [ ] Create Grafana dashboards for monitoring
  - [ ] Implement alerting for critical issues

### 6. Client Libraries

- **Language Bindings**
  - [ ] Enhance Python client with additional features
  - [ ] Create TypeScript/JavaScript client for web applications
  - [ ] Consider adding clients for other languages as needed

- **CLI Tools**
  - [ ] Create command-line tools for interacting with the APIs
  - [ ] Add shell completion and interactive mode
  - [ ] Implement batch processing and automation capabilities

## Long-Term Vision (6+ Months)

### 7. Advanced Features

- **Machine Learning Integration**
  - [ ] Add support for model performance prediction
  - [ ] Implement anomaly detection for test and benchmark results
  - [ ] Create optimization suggestions based on historical data

- **Distributed Execution**
  - [ ] Enhance API to support distributed test execution
  - [ ] Add support for clustered benchmark execution
  - [ ] Implement resource-aware scheduling across multiple nodes

- **Ecosystem Integration**
  - [ ] Create plugins for CI/CD systems (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI)
  - [ ] Add integration with HuggingFace Hub and similar platforms
  - [ ] Develop extensions for cloud deployment and management

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Organization

- Follow the established patterns in the existing FastAPI implementations
- Keep API models, routes, and business logic in separate modules
- Maintain consistent error handling and status reporting

### Testing Approach

- Create unit tests for individual API endpoints and handlers
- Develop integration tests for component interactions
- Implement end-to-end tests for complete workflows

### Documentation Standards

- Document all API endpoints with clear descriptions and examples
- Use typed parameters and response models for better developer experience
- Provide code examples for common operations in multiple languages

## Success Criteria

The API integration work will be considered complete when:

1. All API components have fully implemented endpoints with proper documentation
2. The unified API server provides seamless access to all component APIs
3. Comprehensive tests validate the functionality and reliability of the APIs
4. Client libraries provide convenient access to the APIs from various languages
5. End-to-end workflows demonstrate the integration capabilities
6. The APIs have been validated with real-world use cases and scenarios

## Conclusion

By completing these steps, we will achieve a fully integrated API layer that provides a cohesive and consistent interface across all IPFS Accelerate components. This will significantly reduce code debt, improve user experience, and enable more efficient development workflows.
