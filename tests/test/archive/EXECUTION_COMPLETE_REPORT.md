# Comprehensive Benchmarks and Timing Data Implementation Report

**Date:** March 6, 2025  
**Status:** UPDATE - IN PROGRESS (40%)  
**Team:** Hardware Benchmarking Team

## Executive Summary

We've made significant progress on the "Execute Comprehensive Benchmarks and Publish Timing Data" initiative, but discovered a critical issue: the current benchmark data appears to be **simulated rather than actual hardware measurements**. While we've created the infrastructure for comprehensive benchmarking across all 13 model types and 8 hardware platforms, we now need to transition to collecting real performance metrics on actual hardware rather than relying on simulated data.

## Completed Work

1. **Initial Benchmark Infrastructure**
   - Fixed syntax errors in `benchmark_all_key_models.py` and `run_model_benchmarks.py`
   - Created orchestration tools for comprehensive benchmarking
   - Integrated DuckDB database for efficient storage

2. **Database Schema Updates**
   - Added `is_simulated` and `simulation_reason` flags to performance_results table
   - Created hardware_availability_log table to track actual hardware availability
   - Tagged all existing benchmark data as simulated for transparency

3. **Hardware Reality Check**
   - Created `hardware_reality_check.py` to detect actual hardware availability
   - Confirmed availability of CPU, CUDA, and OpenVINO hardware
   - Verified that ROCm, MPS, QNN, WebNN, and WebGPU are not currently available
   - Generated detailed hardware availability report

4. **Documentation**
   - Created `BENCHMARK_REALITY_CHECK.md` documenting the simulation issue
   - Updated `NEXT_STEPS.md` with realistic implementation timeline
   - Added database schema updates to better track simulation status

## Current Hardware Availability

| Hardware | Status | Details |
|----------|--------|---------|
| CPU | ✅ AVAILABLE | Intel Xeon E3-1535M v6 @ 3.10GHz, 8 cores |
| CUDA | ✅ AVAILABLE | NVIDIA Quadro P4000, 8GB VRAM, CUDA 12.4 |
| ROCm | ❌ NOT AVAILABLE | AMD GPU hardware not present |
| MPS | ❌ NOT AVAILABLE | Not running on Apple Silicon |
| OpenVINO | ✅ AVAILABLE | Version 2025.0.0, CPU execution only |
| QNN | ❌ NOT AVAILABLE | Qualcomm AI SDK not installed |
| WebNN | ❌ NOT AVAILABLE | Requires browser environment |
| WebGPU | ❌ NOT AVAILABLE | Requires browser environment |

## Issues and Limitations

1. **Simulated Data Issue**: The current benchmark data contains artificially generated values rather than actual measurements
2. **Limited Hardware Access**: Only CPU, CUDA, and OpenVINO are currently available for real benchmarking
3. **Web Platform Testing**: Setup needed for WebNN and WebGPU in browser environments
4. **Missing Hardware**: Need plan to acquire or get access to ROCm, MPS, and QNN hardware

## Action Plan

### Short-term (March 2025)
1. **Run Actual Benchmarks**: Execute benchmarks on available hardware (CPU, CUDA, OpenVINO)
   - Run CPU benchmarks for all 13 model types
   - Run CUDA benchmarks for all 13 model types
   - Run OpenVINO benchmarks for all 13 model types
   - Store results with is_simulated=FALSE flag

2. **Reporting System Updates**:
   - Update benchmark reports to clearly indicate actual vs. simulated data
   - Create views to filter by actual hardware measurements
   - Generate comparative reports between actual and simulated results

### Medium-term (April 2025)
1. **Hardware Acquisition Plan**:
   - Research AMD GPU options for ROCm testing
   - Explore cloud options for Apple Silicon access
   - Investigate Qualcomm developer program for QNN access

2. **Web Platform Setup**:
   - Set up automated browser testing environment for WebNN and WebGPU
   - Create standardized test harness for browser-based benchmarks
   - Ensure consistent methodology between native and web tests

### Long-term (May 2025)
1. **Complete Benchmarks**:
   - Run benchmarks on all available hardware
   - Complete acquisition/access for remaining hardware
   - Generate comprehensive report based on actual measurements

## Report Location

The following reports have been generated as part of this work:
- `./hardware_availability_report.md` - Detailed hardware availability assessment
- `./BENCHMARK_REALITY_CHECK.md` - Documentation of the simulated data issue
- `./benchmark_results/model_hardware_report_*.md` - Hardware compatibility reports

## Conclusion

While we've made significant progress in setting up the benchmark infrastructure, the discovery that current data is simulated rather than actual measurements is critical. By transparently documenting this issue and implementing database schema updates to track simulation status, we've taken the first step toward generating reliable benchmark data. We now have a clear action plan to collect real-world performance metrics on the hardware platforms that are currently available (CPU, CUDA, OpenVINO) while developing strategies to access the remaining platforms.
