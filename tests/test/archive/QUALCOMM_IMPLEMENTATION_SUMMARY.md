# Generate power efficiency comparison report
python duckdb_api/core/duckdb_api/core/benchmark_db_query.py --report qualcomm_power_efficiency --format html --output power_report.html
```

### Basic Usage

```python
# Use the integrated hardware detection system
from ipfs_accelerate_py import ipfs_accelerate_py

# Initialize with Qualcomm-aware resources
accelerator = ipfs_accelerate_py(resources, metadata)

# Hardware detection will automatically identify Qualcomm capabilities
hwtest = accelerator.test_hardware()
print(f"Qualcomm hardware detected: {hwtest.get('qualcomm', False)}")

# Run inference on the appropriate hardware
results = await accelerator.infer(model="BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5", data="Hello world", endpoint="qualcomm:0")

## Enhanced Power and Thermal Metrics (March 2025 Update)

The March 2025 update includes comprehensive improvements to power and thermal metrics collection for mobile and edge devices running on Qualcomm hardware. This implementation focuses on model-specific profiling, battery impact analysis, and thermal management insights.

### Model-Specific Power Profiling

Different model types exhibit distinct power consumption patterns:

| Model Type | Power Profile | Thermal Pattern | Battery Impact | Typical Performance |
|------------|---------------|-----------------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Vision** | Medium-high peak, efficient avg | Moderate heat | Medium | 30-50 images/second |
| **Text** | Lower overall, very efficient | Low heat | Low | 50-150 tokens/second |
| **Audio** | Variable with processing spikes | Moderate-high heat | Medium-high | 3-10x realtime |
| **LLM** | Highest power draw, sustained | Highest heat | High | 10-25 tokens/second |

The system automatically detects model type and applies appropriate power profiling based on:
- Model name patterns (e.g., "bert" → text, "vit" → vision)
- Input data characteristics (shape and dimensionality)
- Operation patterns typical of each model family

### Advanced Power Metrics

The enhanced metrics system collects several new metrics:

1. **Energy Efficiency (items/joule)**: Performance normalized to energy consumption
   - For vision models: images processed per joule
   - For text models: tokens processed per joule
   - For audio models: seconds of audio processed per joule
   - For LLMs: tokens generated per joule

2. **Thermal Throttling Detection**: Automatic detection of thermal throttling events
   - Detects when temperature exceeds thresholds
   - Reports throttling conditions that may impact performance
   - Identifies models prone to thermal management issues

3. **Battery Impact Analysis**: Estimated battery drain during operation
   - Battery percentage used per hour of continuous operation
   - Estimated operation time on typical battery capacity
   - Power profile categorization (efficient, moderate, heavy)

4. **Model-Type Aware Throughput**: Performance metrics tailored to model type
   - Vision: images/second
   - Text: tokens/second
   - Audio: seconds of audio/second (real-time factor)
   - LLM: tokens/second

### Enhanced Database Schema

The implementation includes a comprehensive schema for storing power and thermal metrics in the DuckDB database with model-specific profiling support:

```sql
-- Dedicated table for power and thermal metrics (enhanced March 2025)
CREATE TABLE power_metrics (
    metric_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    test_result_id INTEGER,
    run_id INTEGER,

### Enhanced QNNSDKWrapper (April 2025)

The April 2025 update includes a significant enhancement with the replacement of the previous MockQNNSDK implementation with a robust QNNSDKWrapper class that provides:

```python
class QNNSDKWrapper:
    """
    Wrapper for QNN SDK with proper error handling and simulation detection.
    This replaces the previous MockQNNSDK implementation with a more robust approach.
    """
    def __init__(self, version: str = "2.10", simulation_mode: bool = False):
        self.version = version
        self.available = False
        self.simulation_mode = simulation_mode
        self.devices = []
        self.current_device = None
        
        if simulation_mode:
            logger.warning("QNN SDK running in SIMULATION mode. No real hardware will be used.")
            self._setup_simulation()
        else:
            logger.info(f"Attempting to initialize QNN SDK version {version}")
```

Key benefits of the enhanced implementation:

1. **Clear Simulation Indication**:
   - Explicit simulation_mode flag in all results
   - Warning messages in logs when running in simulation mode
   - Simulation flags propagated to database records

2. **Improved Error Handling**:
   - Proper detection of SDK availability
   - Clear error messages when hardware or SDK is unavailable
   - Graceful fallback to simulation mode when requested

3. **Consistent API**:
   - Same interface for real hardware and simulation
   - All methods properly handle simulation status
   - Centralized hardware detection integration

4. **Enhanced Logging**:
   - Comprehensive logging of detection process
   - Clear indication of simulation mode in logs
   - Detailed error reporting and diagnostics

This enhancement ensures that users can clearly distinguish between real hardware tests and simulations, leading to more reliable deployment decisions and performance expectations.

## Future Improvements

6. **Visual Analytics**: Enhanced visualization of power and thermal metrics
7. **Dynamic Resource Allocation**: Intelligent resource management based on workload

## Template Integration

The Qualcomm AI Engine support has been integrated into the template system to enable easy test generation:

```bash
# Generate a BERT test with Qualcomm support
python generators/generators/test_generators/simple_test_generator.py -g bert -p qualcomm -o test_bert_qualcomm.py

# Generate a vision model test with Qualcomm support
python generators/generators/test_generators/simple_test_generator.py -g vit -p qualcomm -o test_vit_qualcomm.py

# Generate a test with all hardware platforms including Qualcomm
python generators/generators/test_generators/simple_test_generator.py -g bert -p all
```

The templates include specialized Qualcomm hardware detection:

```python
# Qualcomm hardware detection in templates
HAS_QUALCOMM = (
    importlib.util.find_spec("qnn_wrapper") is not None or 
    importlib.util.find_spec("qti") is not None or
    "QUALCOMM_SDK" in os.environ
)

def test_qualcomm(self):
    """Test model on Qualcomm AI Engine."""
    if not HAS_QUALCOMM:
        self.skipTest("Qualcomm AI Engine not available")
    
    # Qualcomm-specific model loading
    model = AutoModel.from_pretrained(self.model_name)
    
    # Run inference with power monitoring
    with QualcommPowerMonitor() as monitor:
        outputs = model(**inputs)
        power_usage = monitor.get_power_usage()
        temperature = monitor.get_temperature()
    
    self.assertIsNotNone(outputs)
    logger.info(f"Power usage: {power_usage}W, Temperature: {temperature}°C")
```

The integration has been verified as part of the template system verification:

```bash
python test/run_template_system_check.py
```
