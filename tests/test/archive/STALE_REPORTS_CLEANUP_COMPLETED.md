# Stale Reports Cleanup Completed

**Date: April 6, 2025**

## Task Summary

We have successfully completed task #10 from the NEXT_STEPS.md roadmap: "Critical Benchmark System Issues", with a focus on cleaning up stale and misleading benchmark reports. This involved:

1. Creating tools to identify reports with potentially misleading data
2. Marking these reports with clear warnings
3. Adding simulation detection to the database schema
4. Enhancing report generators with validation functions
5. Creating verification tools for the database

## Key Achievements

### 1. Database Enhancements

- Added simulation flags to all relevant database tables
- Created hardware_availability_log table for tracking detection status
- Implemented update_db_schema_for_simulation.py utility
- Enhanced all database integration code to use simulation flags

### 2. Report Cleanup

- Identified and marked 125 potentially problematic reports
- Added clear warning headers to HTML, Markdown, and JSON files
- Archived problematic files for reference purposes
- Fixed report generator scripts to include validation

### 3. Tools Development

- Created cleanup_stale_reports.py utility for report scanning and marking
- Created view_benchmark_results.py for database verification and reporting
- Enhanced benchmark scripts to properly handle simulation

### 4. Documentation

- Created comprehensive documentation in BENCHMARK_DB_FIX.md
- Added detailed implementation guide in SIMULATION_DETECTION_IMPROVEMENTS_GUIDE.md
- Updated CLAUDE.md with new tools and commands
- Updated NEXT_STEPS.md to mark tasks as completed

## Results

The completion of this task ensures that all benchmark reports now clearly distinguish between real hardware results and simulated results, providing transparency and data integrity for all benchmarking activities.

## Verification

We have successfully:

1. Run benchmarks on CPU and WebGPU with proper detection
2. Run simulated benchmarks on ROCm with proper simulation flags
3. Verified correct database storage of simulation status
4. Generated reports showing clear distinction between real and simulated results
5. Used the new tools to verify simulation status in the database

## Next Steps

With task #10 now complete, we can focus on remaining items in the NEXT_STEPS.md roadmap:

1. Continue working on item #9: "Execute Comprehensive Benchmarks and Publish Timing Data"
2. Prepare for item #12: "Distributed Testing Framework"
3. Plan work for item #13: "Predictive Performance System"

All these future tasks will now benefit from the improved data integrity and simulation awareness in the benchmark system.
