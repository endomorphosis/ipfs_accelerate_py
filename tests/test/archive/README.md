# Archive Directory

This directory contains archived files from the IPFS Accelerate Python project that are no longer actively used but are kept for reference.

## Directory Structure

- `backup_files/`: Contains backup files (*.bak) from the codebase
- `old_reports/`: Contains old benchmark reports, test reports, and results files
- `stale_scripts/`: Contains deprecated Python scripts that are no longer actively used
- `old_documentation/`: Contains older Markdown documentation files

## Archiving Process

These files were archived on March 10, 2025, as part of a cleanup operation to reduce clutter in the main codebase. The directory structure from the original location has been preserved within each archive subfolder.

## Retrieval

If you need to access any of these archived files, you can find them in this directory with the same relative path structure as they had in the original location.

## Scripts Used for Archiving

- `archive_backups.sh`: Script used to archive backup files and old reports
- `archive_stale.sh`: Script used to archive stale scripts and old documentation

The archiving was performed to improve the organization of the codebase while ensuring that historical files remain available for reference when needed.
