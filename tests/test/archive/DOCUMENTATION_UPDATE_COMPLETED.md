## Conclusion

The documentation created provides comprehensive guides for three major system components:

1. **Simulation Detection and Stale Reports Cleanup**: Complete documentation on the improved simulation detection system and the process for cleaning up stale benchmark reports, ensuring clear identification of simulated versus real hardware results.

2. **Safari WebGPU Fallback System**: A guide to using and extending the fallback mechanisms to ensure reliable WebGPU performance across all browsers, with special focus on Safari's unique constraints.

3. **CI/CD Integration for Test Results**: A complete guide to the automated testing, result storage, report generation, and regression detection system implemented with GitHub Actions.

All three implementations address high-priority items from the NEXT_STEPS.md file and provide significant enhancements to the IPFS Accelerate framework:

- The Simulation Detection system ensures transparency and reliability in benchmark reporting
- The Safari WebGPU fallback system ensures optimal cross-browser compatibility
- The CI/CD integration system automates testing and reporting, improving development efficiency

These systems work together to provide a robust foundation for continued framework development, with the CI/CD system ensuring that new features maintain compatibility and performance across releases, the simulation detection system ensuring data integrity, and the Safari WebGPU fallback providing cross-browser support.
