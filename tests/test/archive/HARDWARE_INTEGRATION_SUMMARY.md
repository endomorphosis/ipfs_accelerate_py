- Memory-efficient resource sharing across components
- Device-specific model caching
- Low memory mode with adaptive behavior

### 4. Hardware-Model Integration
- Unified interface between hardware detection and model classification

- Standardized error format with severity levels
- Detailed recommendations for resolving compatibility issues
- Comprehensive compatibility matrix generation
- Support for both JSON and Markdown report formats

## Hardware Compatibility Matrix

The framework uses a dynamic hardware compatibility matrix to determine optimal device placement for different model families:

| Model Family | CUDA | ROCm (AMD) | MPS (Apple) | OpenVINO | WebNN | WebGPU | Notes |
|--------------|------|------------|-------------|----------|-------|--------|-------|
| Embedding (BERT, etc.) | ✅ High | ✅ High | ✅ High | ✅ Medium | ✅ High | ✅ Medium | Efficient on all hardware |
| Text Generation (LLMs) | ✅ High | ✅ Medium | ✅ Medium | ✅ Low | ❌ | ✅ Low | Memory requirements critical |
| Vision (ViT, CLIP, etc.) | ✅ High | ✅ Medium | ✅ High | ✅ High | ✅ Medium | ✅ Medium | OpenVINO optimized |
| Audio (Whisper, etc.) | ✅ High | ✅ Medium | ✅ Medium | ✅ Medium | ❌ | ❌ | CUDA preferred |
| Multimodal (LLaVA, etc.) | ✅ High | ❌ Low | ❌ Low | ❌ Low | ❌ | ❌ | Primarily CUDA only |

## Multi-Level Fallback System

The framework implements a robust fallback system when components are missing or hardware is unavailable:

1. **Component-Level Fallbacks**:
   - When generators/hardware/hardware_detection.py is missing → Use basic PyTorch device detection
   - When model_family_classifier.py is missing → Use heuristic classification based on model name
   - When both are missing → Use user-provided device preference or default to CPU

2. **Hardware-Level Fallbacks**:
   - When preferred hardware is unavailable → Fall back to next in priority list
   - When memory requirements exceed GPU capacity → Fall back to CPU
   - When specialized hardware operations fail → Fall back to general-purpose hardware

3. **Error-Handling Fallbacks**:
   - When initialization fails → Provide detailed error messages and recommendations
   - When hardware is incompatible → Suggest alternative hardware or model
   - When memory pressure is detected → Provide memory optimization recommendations

## Error Reporting System

The hardware compatibility error reporting system provides comprehensive error detection and reporting:

### Error Categories
1. **Critical Errors**: Prevent operation completely (e.g., missing required components)
2. **Errors**: Prevent specific hardware usage but alternatives exist (e.g., CUDA initialization failure)
3. **Warnings**: Degraded functionality but operation continues (e.g., low memory available)
4. **Info**: Informational messages about compatibility (e.g., WebNN requires browser environment)

### Report Types
1. **Markdown Reports**: Detailed reports with error descriptions, recommendations, and error details
2. **JSON Reports**: Structured data format for programmatic processing
3. **Compatibility Matrices**: Visual representation of hardware-model compatibility

### Recommendation System
The error reporting system provides actionable recommendations based on the error type:

```
Hardware: CUDA
Error: memory_pressure
Recommendations:
- Close other applications using GPU memory
- Try using a smaller model or batch size
- Consider using mixed precision (FP16) to reduce memory usage
- Split the model across multiple GPUs if available
```

## Usage

### Collecting Errors and Generating Reports
```bash
# Collect errors from all components and generate a report
python test/hardware_compatibility_reporter.py --collect-all

# Generate a hardware compatibility matrix
python test/hardware_compatibility_reporter.py --matrix

# Test the full hardware stack
python test/hardware_compatibility_reporter.py --test-hardware

# Check compatibility for a specific model
python test/hardware_compatibility_reporter.py --check-model bert-base-uncased

# Generate a JSON format report
python test/hardware_compatibility_reporter.py --collect-all --format json
```

### Programmatic Usage
```python
from hardware_compatibility_reporter import HardwareCompatibilityReporter

# Create a reporter instance
reporter = HardwareCompatibilityReporter()

# Collect errors from various components
reporter.check_components()
reporter.collect_hardware_detection_errors()
reporter.collect_resource_pool_errors()
reporter.collect_model_integration_errors("bert-base-uncased")
reporter.test_full_hardware_stack()

# Generate reports
markdown_report = reporter.generate_report(format="markdown")
json_report = reporter.generate_report(format="json")
matrix = reporter.generate_compatibility_matrix()

# Save to file
reporter.save_to_file(markdown_report, "hardware_report.md")
```

## Resilient Error Handling Architecture

The hardware integration system uses a layered approach to ensure resilient error handling:

1. **Component Existence Checking**: Check file existence before attempting imports
2. **Import Protection**: Catch import errors and provide meaningful fallbacks
3. **Runtime Error Handling**: Catch runtime errors during hardware initialization and usage
4. **Standardized Error Format**: Use a consistent error format across all components
5. **Centralized Error Collection**: Collect errors from all components in a single system
6. **Severity Classification**: Classify errors by severity for prioritized handling
7. **Comprehensive Recommendations**: Provide actionable recommendations for each error type
8. **Detailed Reporting**: Generate detailed reports with error information and recommendations

## Conclusion

The hardware integration system provides a comprehensive, resilient, and cross-platform solution for deploying models across diverse hardware environments. With robust error detection, reporting, and recommendations, the system enables users to quickly identify and resolve compatibility issues while providing graceful fallbacks when components are missing or hardware is unavailable.
