To use the WebNN/WebGPU Resource Pool Bridge Integration, see the following example:

```python
from fixed_web_platform.resource_pool_bridge import create_ipfs_web_accelerator

# Create accelerator with default settings
accelerator = create_ipfs_web_accelerator()

# Load a model with WebGPU acceleration
model = accelerator.accelerate_model(
    model_name="bert-base-uncased",
    model_type="text",
    platform="webgpu"
)

# Create input data
inputs = {
    "input_ids": [101, 2023, 2003, 1037, 3231, 102],
    "attention_mask": [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
}

# Run inference
result = accelerator.run_inference("bert-base-uncased", inputs)

# Get performance metrics
metrics = accelerator.integration.get_metrics()
print(f"Inference time: {metrics['aggregate']['avg_inference_time']:.4f}s")
print(f"Throughput: {metrics['aggregate']['avg_throughput']:.2f} items/s")

# Clean up resources
accelerator.close()
```

For concurrent model execution:

```python
from fixed_web_platform.resource_pool_bridge import ResourcePoolBridgeIntegration

# Create integration with browser preferences
integration = ResourcePoolBridgeIntegration(
    max_connections=3,
    browser_preferences={
        'audio': 'firefox',  # Firefox best for audio
        'vision': 'chrome',  # Chrome best for vision
        'text': 'edge'       # Edge best for text
    }
)

# Initialize integration
integration.initialize()

# Load multiple models
bert_model = integration.get_model(
    model_type="text",
    model_name="bert-base-uncased",
    hardware_preferences={
        'priority_list': ['webgpu', 'cpu'],
        'enable_ipfs': True
    }
)

vit_model = integration.get_model(
    model_type="vision",
    model_name="vit-base-patch16-224",
    hardware_preferences={
        'priority_list': ['webgpu', 'cpu'],
        'enable_ipfs': True,
        'precompile_shaders': True
    }

whisper_model = integration.get_model(
    model_type="audio",
    model_name="whisper-tiny",
    hardware_preferences={
        'priority_list': ['webgpu', 'cpu'],
        'enable_ipfs': True,
        'use_firefox_optimizations': True
    }
)

# Run concurrent inference
model_inputs = [
    (bert_model.model_id, bert_inputs),
    (vit_model.model_id, vit_inputs),
    (whisper_model.model_id, whisper_inputs)
