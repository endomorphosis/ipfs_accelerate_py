## Conclusion

With the completion of the "Cleanup stale and misleading reports" task (item #10 in NEXT_STEPS.md) and the addition of enhanced documentation and report cleanup tools, the simulation detection and flagging system is now fully implemented and integrated throughout the framework. Users can now trust that all benchmark reports clearly distinguish between real hardware results and simulated data, enabling better decision-making and proper interpretation of performance metrics.

The combination of database schema updates, improved hardware detection, report generation enhancements, stale report cleanup, and enhanced documentation cleanup ensures a comprehensive solution to the simulation detection challenge. This work provides a solid foundation for the remaining tasks in the NEXT_STEPS.md roadmap.

The newly added documentation and report cleanup tools further enhance the system by providing systematic ways to maintain a clean and accurate documentation structure, ensuring that users always have access to the most up-to-date and accurate information.
