# Test Standardization Progress Report - March 23, 2025

## Today's Progress

Today we made significant progress standardizing test files to comply with the ModelTest base class pattern:

1. Fixed 3 files with syntax errors and converted them to ModelTest:
   - `/test_whisper-tiny.py` - Audio model test with proper implementation
   - `/test_bert-base-uncased.py` - Text model test with complete methods
   - `/test_bert_simple.py` - Refactored into proper ModelTest structure
   - `/test_bert_fixed.py` - Fixed syntax and converted to ModelTest

2. Updated our standardization tracking:
   - Increased compliance rate from 19.5% to 29.3% (12 of 41 files)
   - Resolved all identified syntax errors in except/finally blocks
   - Created detailed documentation of changes in standardization_summary.md

3. Established a clear pattern for standardization:
   - Import ModelTest with fallback options for different import paths
   - Convert initialization from __init__ to setUp method with super() call
   - Implement required methods: test_model_loading, load_model, verify_model_output, detect_preferred_device
   - Add unittest-compatible test methods for seamless integration
   - Support both script-style execution and unittest framework

## Next Steps

1. Group remaining 29 files by model type and prioritize high-usage models
2. Apply standardization tool to add missing methods to remaining files
3. Create validation batch script for tracking compliance
4. Proceed to comprehensive test generation once standardization is complete

## Compliance Status

- Compliant files: 12/41 (29.3%)
- Non-compliant files: 29/41 (70.7%)
- All syntax error files fixed (3 of 3)
