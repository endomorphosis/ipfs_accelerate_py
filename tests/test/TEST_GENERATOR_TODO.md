# Test Generator System - TODO List

This document outlines the remaining tasks to enhance and complete the test generator system for HuggingFace models.

## High Priority

1. **Fix Template Syntax Issues**
   - Implement better template parsing to handle Jinja syntax properly
   - Improve indent/dedent handling to ensure syntactically valid Python
   - Add specialized regex patterns for common template patterns

2. **Validate All Generated Tests**
   - Implement a validator that can run `python -m py_compile` on all generated tests
   - Create a report of valid vs. invalid generated tests
   - Fix the most common template rendering issues

3. **Add Missing Models**
   - Update architecture mappings with any newly released models
   - Add specific test cases for popular new models
   - Ensure all mappings are accurate and up-to-date

4. **Improve Hardware Detection**
   - Implement the hardware detection components from the architecture design
   - Create specialized hardware detectors for each supported platform
   - Add device benchmarking for optimal device selection

## Medium Priority

5. **Template Enhancements**
   - Update templates with the latest model features and APIs
   - Add template variations for different test scenarios
   - Support for quantized models and specialized inference modes

6. **Test Runner Integration**
   - Implement a test runner that can execute the generated tests
   - Add result collection and reporting
   - Integrate with existing test infrastructure

7. **CI/CD Integration**
   - Add GitHub Actions workflow for automatic test generation
   - Implement automated daily/weekly test runs
   - Create dashboards for test coverage and results

8. **Template Customization**
   - Add command-line options for template customization
   - Support for user-provided templates
   - Template inheritance and composition

## Low Priority

9. **Documentation**
   - Create comprehensive documentation for the generator system
   - Add examples and tutorials
   - Document the template language and variables

10. **Performance Optimization**
    - Optimize template rendering for large batches
    - Add parallel execution for test generation
    - Improve file I/O and template caching

11. **User Interface**
    - Add a simple web UI for test generation
    - Create interactive template editing
    - Add visualization of test coverage

12. **Integration with Model Registry**
    - Connect to HuggingFace Hub for model discovery
    - Automatically generate tests for new models
    - Track test coverage across the model ecosystem

## Completed Tasks

- ✅ Created architecture map for model types to template architectures
- ✅ Implemented basic template rendering with variable replacement
- ✅ Added support for conditional blocks in templates
- ✅ Created template files for all major architectures
- ✅ Implemented basic syntax validation and fixing
- ✅ Added batch generation capability
- ✅ Created summary reporting for generation results
- ✅ Implemented command-line interfaces for both generators

## Next Steps (July 2025)

1. Focus on fixing template syntax issues to ensure all generated tests are valid Python
2. Validate all existing templates with a systematic approach
3. Update templates with missing models from recent releases
4. Improve the CLI for easier use in automation
5. Create a comprehensive test coverage report

## Long-term Vision

The long-term vision for the test generator system is to:

1. Achieve 100% coverage of all HuggingFace model architectures
2. Automate test generation as part of the CI/CD pipeline
3. Provide a flexible, template-based system that can adapt to new models
4. Support hardware-aware test generation for optimal performance
5. Integrate with monitoring and reporting systems for comprehensive test coverage tracking

By completing these tasks, we'll create a robust, maintainable test infrastructure that ensures all models work correctly across all supported platforms and hardware configurations.
