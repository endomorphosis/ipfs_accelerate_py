# Cross-Browser Model Sharding Guide

**Last Updated: May 25, 2025**

## Overview

Cross-Browser Model Sharding is an advanced system for distributing large AI models across multiple browser tabs and browser types to leverage browser-specific optimizations for different model components. This system enables running large models that would normally exceed the memory capabilities of a single browser context, with enterprise-grade fault tolerance capabilities.

## Key Features

- **Cross-Browser Distribution**: Run model components across Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari simultaneously
- **Optimization Targeting**: Place model components on the browser best suited for their operation type
- **Browser-Specific Optimizations**:
  - Chrome: Vision models, multimodal processing, parallel tensor operations
  - Firefox: Audio/speech models, optimized compute shaders for audio processing
  - Edge: Text models, embeddings, WebNN integration
  - Safari: Power-efficient operations, Metal integration for iOS/macOS
- **Dynamic Shard Assignment**: Intelligently distributes model layers based on browser capabilities
- **Enterprise-Grade Fault Tolerance**: 
  - Implements distributed consensus for state management
  - Transaction-based component recovery
  - Circuit breaker pattern to prevent cascading failures
  - Dependency-aware recovery planning
  - Automatic failover with state preservation
  - Comprehensive metrics collection and analysis
  - Advanced fault tolerance validation
- **Multiple Sharding Strategies**: 
  - Layer-based: Distributes model layers across browsers
  - Attention-Feedforward: Separates attention and feedforward components
  - Component-based: Distributes by model components (e.g., text encoder, vision encoder)
  - Hybrid: Combines strategies for optimal performance
- **Performance History Integration**: Uses historical performance data to make optimal browser assignments
- **Distributed Testing Framework Integration**: Leverages advanced fault tolerance from the distributed testing system

## Architecture

The system uses a coordinated approach to model sharding with robust fault tolerance:

### Core Architecture

1. A central Python coordinator determines the optimal distribution of model components
2. Each browser loads a subset of the model based on its capabilities
3. Browser-specific optimizations are applied based on each browser's strengths
4. Inference is performed across all browsers in parallel
5. Results are combined through a central aggregation system

### Fault Tolerance Layer

The fault tolerance architecture follows a distributed systems approach:

1. **Coordinator Redundancy**: Multiple coordinator instances maintain synchronized state through Raft consensus
2. **Transaction-Based Operations**: All component operations (initialization, inference, etc.) are managed as transactions
3. **State Replication**: Critical state is replicated across multiple browsers to enable recovery
4. **Recovery Workflow**:
   * Failure detection through heartbeat monitoring
   * State assessment to identify missing components
   * Recovery planning based on component dependencies 
   * Component redeployment to available browsers
   * State restoration from transaction log
   * Comprehensive integrity verification

### Fault Tolerance Validation System

The system includes a comprehensive validation framework that:

1. **Tests Multiple Failure Scenarios**:
   * Connection loss: Simulates sudden connection loss to browser
   * Browser crash: Simulates complete browser crash
   * Component timeout: Simulates component operation timeout
   * Multi-browser failure: Simulates multiple browser failures simultaneously
   * Cascade failure: Simulates cascading failures across components
   * Network instability: Simulates packet loss and connection flakiness

2. **Validation Metrics Collection**:
   * Recovery time measurements across scenarios
   * Success rate tracking for each recovery strategy
   * Performance impact assessment of fault tolerance features
   * System integrity verification after recovery

3. **Analysis and Reporting**:
   * Comparative analysis of different sharding strategies
   * Recovery performance across different fault tolerance levels
   * Visualization of recovery metrics and success rates
   * Recommendations for optimal configuration based on workload

### Integration with Distributed Testing Framework

The system integrates with the Distributed Testing Framework for enhanced reliability:

1. **Consensus Algorithm**: Uses the Raft consensus implementation from the distributed testing framework
2. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**: Adopts the distributed testing framework's circuit breaker to prevent cascading failures
3. **Worker Management**: Leverages the worker registration and monitoring subsystem
4. **Performance Metrics**: Shares telemetry with the distributed testing framework for analysis
5. **Recovery Strategies**: Implements the progressive recovery approach from the distributed testing framework

## Browser Specialization 

The system leverages each browser's unique strengths:

| Browser | Best For | Optimizations | Precision Support |
|---------|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Chrome | Vision, Multimodal | Parallel tensor ops, WebGPU compute | FP32, FP16, INT8, INT4 |
| Firefox | Audio, Speech | Audio compute shaders, specialized audio processing | FP32, FP16, INT8, INT4 |
| Edge | Text, Embeddings | WebNN integration, optimized text kernels | FP32, FP16, INT8, INT4 |
| Safari | Vision, Mobile | Metal integration, power efficiency | FP32, FP16, INT8 |

## Sharding Strategies

The system supports four primary sharding strategies:

1. **Optimal** (default): Places model components on browsers best suited for those components
2. **Layer-based**: Distributes layers proportionally based on browser memory limits
3. **Component-based**: Distributes by high-level components (encoders, decoders, etc.)
4. **Attention-Feedforward**: Separates attention and feedforward components for specialized processing

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from fixed_web_platform.cross_browser_model_sharding import CrossBrowserModelShardingManager

# Create a cross-browser sharding manager for a large model
manager = CrossBrowserModelShardingManager(
    model_name="llama-70b",
    browsers=["chrome", "firefox", "edge"],
    shard_type="optimal",  # Use optimal component placement
    enable_fault_tolerance=True  # Enable enterprise-grade fault tolerance
)

# Initialize the shards (opens browser tabs)
await manager.initialize()

# Run inference across all browsers with fault tolerance
result = await manager.run_inference({
    "text": "This is a test input",
    "max_length": 100,
    "temperature": 0.7,
    "fault_tolerance_options": {
        "recovery_timeout": 30,  # Maximum recovery time in seconds
        "max_retries": 3,        # Number of retry attempts for failed components
        "recovery_strategy": "progressive",  # Progressive recovery strategy
        "state_preservation": True  # Preserve state during recovery
    }
})

# Get output
output = result["output"]
print(output)

# Examine browser-specific outputs
browser_outputs = result["browser_outputs"]
for browser, output in browser_outputs.items():
    print(f"{browser}: {output}")

# Get detailed metrics including recovery information
metrics = result["metrics"]
if "recovery_events" in metrics:
    for event in metrics["recovery_events"]:
        print(f"Recovery: {event['component']} - {event['action']} - {event['duration_ms']}ms")

# Clean up
await manager.shutdown()
```

### Using Performance History Integration

```python
from fixed_web_platform.cross_browser_model_sharding import CrossBrowserModelShardingManager
from fixed_web_platform.browser_performance_history import BrowserPerformanceHistory

# Create performance history tracker
history = BrowserPerformanceHistory(db_path="./browser_performance.duckdb")

# Create a cross-browser sharding manager with performance history
manager = CrossBrowserModelShardingManager(
    model_name="llama-13b",
    shard_type="optimal",
    browser_performance_history=history,  # Use performance history for optimal assignment
    enable_fault_tolerance=True
)

# Initialize with performance-based browser assignment
await manager.initialize()

# Run inference with automatic performance tracking
result = await manager.run_inference({
    "text": "This is a test input",
    "max_length": 100
})

# Performance metrics will be automatically recorded to the history database
# for future optimization of browser assignments
```

### Advanced Fault Tolerance Configuration

    }
)

# Initialize with fault tolerance options
await manager.initialize()

# Run inference with advanced fault tolerance
result = await manager.run_inference({
    "text": "This is a test input for advanced fault tolerance",
    "max_length": 100
})

# Examine recovery metrics
recovery_metrics = result.get("metrics", {}).get("recovery_metrics", {})
print(f"Recovery time: {recovery_metrics.get('total_recovery_time_ms', 0)}ms")
print(f"Components recovered: {recovery_metrics.get('components_recovered', 0)}")
```

### Using the Fault Tolerance Validator

    "test_scenarios": [
        "connection_lost",
        "browser_crash",
        "component_timeout",
        "multi_browser_failure"
    ]
}
validator = FaultToleranceValidator(manager, validator_config)

# Run comprehensive validation
validation_results = await validator.validate_fault_tolerance()

# Analyze results
analysis = validator.analyze_results(validation_results)

# Get insights and recommendations
for insight in analysis.get("insights", []):
    print(f"Insight: {insight}")

for recommendation in analysis.get("recommendations", []):
    print(f"Recommendation: {recommendation}")

# Clean up
await manager.shutdown()
```

### Command-Line Testing and Validation

## Use Cases

### Large LLM Deployment (70B+)

For large language models that exceed single browser memory limits:

```python
manager = CrossBrowserModelShardingManager(
    model_name="llama-70b",
    browsers=["chrome", "firefox", "edge"],
    shard_type="optimal"
)
```

This configuration will:
- Place embedding and feedforward layers on Edge (optimized for text)
- Place attention layers on Chrome (parallel tensor operations)
- Place LM head on Edge (optimized for text generation)

### Multimodal Models

For models that process multiple input types (text + images + audio):

```python
manager = CrossBrowserModelShardingManager(
    model_name="clip-large",
    browsers=["chrome", "edge"],
    shard_type="optimal"
)
```

This will place text encoders on Edge and vision encoders on Chrome.

### Audio Processing Models

For speech-to-text or audio analysis models:

```python
manager = CrossBrowserModelShardingManager(
    model_name="whisper-large",
    browsers=["firefox", "edge"],
    shard_type="optimal"
)
```

This will place audio encoders on Firefox (optimized for audio) and text decoders on Edge.

### High-Reliability Production Systems

For mission-critical systems requiring maximum fault tolerance:

```python
manager = CrossBrowserModelShardingManager(
    model_name="llama-13b",
    browsers=["chrome", "firefox", "edge", "safari"],  # Include all browser types
    shard_type="component_based",
    enable_fault_tolerance=True,
    fault_tolerance_level="critical",
    recovery_strategy="coordinated"
)
```

This configuration provides:
- Maximum redundancy across all browsers
- Coordinated recovery with state preservation
- Transaction-based state management
- Automatic failover with minimal disruption

## Best Practices

### Browser and Model Configuration

1. **Browser Selection**: Include browsers that match your model's components
   - Text-heavy models: Include Edge
   - Vision models: Include Chrome
   - Audio models: Include Firefox
   - For critical workloads: Include at least 3 different browser types

2. **Shard Count**: Determine based on model size and available browsers
   - Rule of thumb: 4GB model size per shard minimum
   - Example: A 70B model (~140GB in FP16) needs at least 35 shards at 4GB per shard
   - For fault tolerance: Add 20% more shards than minimum required

3. **Browser Configuration**:
   - Disable browser throttling for background tabs
   - Increase memory limits where possible
   - Use Chromium-based browsers in performance mode
   - Set appropriate garbage collection intervals

### Fault Tolerance Configuration

1. **Recovery Strategy**: Match to workload requirements
   - **Simple**: Simple retries for non-critical applications
   - **Progressive**: Browser reassignment with state preservation for general production use
   - **Parallel**: Fast recovery with higher resource usage for latency-sensitive applications
   - **Coordinated**: Full distributed consensus for mission-critical applications

2. **Component Redundancy**: Configure based on importance
   - **Critical components**: Set redundancy factor to 2-3 (replicate across browsers)
   - **Standard components**: Set redundancy factor to 1.5
   - **Optional components**: No redundancy necessary

3. **Transaction Management**:
   - Enable transaction logging for all production deployments
   - Use persistent storage for transaction logs in critical applications
   - Configure transaction checkpoint frequency based on model type:
     - Generative models: Every 25-50 tokens
     - Vision/audio models: After each processing stage

4. **Recovery Tuning**:
   - Configure recovery timeouts based on component size (larger components need longer timeouts)
   - Set progressive recovery for large models (recover most critical components first)
   - Enable parallel recovery when multiple components fail simultaneously

### Performance Optimization

1. **Performance History**:
   - Always enable performance history tracking for production deployments
   - Allow at least 10 inference runs before relying on browser optimization recommendations
   - Schedule periodic browser reassignment based on performance data (every 100 inferences)

2. **Load Balancing**:
   - Enable dynamic load balancing for long-running inference tasks
   - Set rebalance frequency based on workload (higher for bursty workloads)
   - Configure browser-specific memory thresholds to prevent OOM errors

3. **Metrics Collection**:
   - Enable comprehensive metrics collection for production systems
   - Store metrics in a database for historical analysis
   - Generate regular reports on recovery performance and success rates
   - Use visualization tools to identify potential improvements

### Testing and Validation

1. **Comprehensive Testing**:
   - Run the fault tolerance validation tool in comprehensive mode before deployment
   - Test all failure scenarios relevant to your deployment environment
   - Test with production-like workloads and model sizes
   - Validate across all browser types you plan to use

2. **Continuous Validation**:
   - Set up regular validation runs in your CI/CD pipeline
   - Monitor recovery performance trends over time
   - Update your configuration based on performance data
   - Benchmark against similar deployments

3. **Stress Testing**:
   - Run stress tests with concurrent requests
   - Simulate multiple simultaneous failures
   - Test with varying network conditions
   - Validate performance under extreme load

## Integration with IPFS Acceleration

Cross-Browser Model Sharding integrates with IPFS acceleration to provide efficient distributed content delivery:

```python
from ipfs_accelerate_py import accelerate
from cross_browser_model_sharding import CrossBrowserModelShardingManager

# Create accelerated cross-browser manager
manager = CrossBrowserModelShardingManager(
    model_name="llama-70b",
    browsers=["chrome", "firefox", "edge"]
)

# Initialize with IPFS acceleration
await manager.initialize(
    ipfs_accelerate=True,
    content_hash="QmHash..."
)

# Run inference with accelerated content delivery
result = await manager.run_inference({
    "text": "This is a test input",
    "max_length": 100
})
