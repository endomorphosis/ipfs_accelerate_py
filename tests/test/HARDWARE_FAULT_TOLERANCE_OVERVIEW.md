## Usage Examples

### Basic Recovery Handling

```python
from duckdb_api.distributed_testing.hardware_aware_fault_tolerance import (
    create_recovery_manager, apply_recovery_action
)

# Create a recovery manager with ML pattern detection
recovery_manager = create_recovery_manager(
    coordinator=coordinator,
    db_manager=db_manager,
    scheduler=scheduler,
    enable_ml=True
)

# Handle a failure
def on_task_failure(task_id, worker_id, error_info):
    # Determine recovery action
    recovery_action = recovery_manager.handle_failure(
        task_id=task_id,
        worker_id=worker_id,
        error_info=error_info
    )
    
    # Apply the recovery action
    apply_recovery_action(
        task_id=task_id,
        action=recovery_action,
        coordinator=coordinator,
        scheduler=scheduler
    )
```

### Checkpoint Management

```python
# Create a checkpoint during task execution
checkpoint_data = {
    "model_state": model.state_dict(),
    "optimizer_state": optimizer.state_dict(),
    "epoch": current_epoch,
    "batch_idx": batch_idx,
    "results": intermediate_results
}

checkpoint_id = recovery_manager.create_checkpoint(task_id, checkpoint_data)

# Resume from the latest checkpoint after a failure
latest_checkpoint = recovery_manager.get_latest_checkpoint(task_id)
if latest_checkpoint:
    model.load_state_dict(latest_checkpoint["model_state"])
    optimizer.load_state_dict(latest_checkpoint["optimizer_state"])
    start_epoch = latest_checkpoint["epoch"]
    start_batch = latest_checkpoint["batch_idx"]
```

### Pattern Analysis and Visualization

```python
# Get all detected patterns
patterns = recovery_manager.get_failure_patterns()

# Analyze ML-detected patterns
if recovery_manager.enable_ml and recovery_manager.ml_detector:
    ml_patterns = recovery_manager.ml_detector.detect_patterns()
    
    for pattern in ml_patterns:
        print(f"ML Pattern ({pattern['confidence']:.2f}): {pattern['description']}")

# Generate visualizations and report
report_path = recovery_manager.create_visualization(output_dir="./visualizations")

# Open the report in a browser
import webbrowser
webbrowser.open(f"file://{os.path.abspath(report_path)}")
```

### Running the Visualization Tool

```bash
# Generate visualizations from simulated data
python run_fault_tolerance_visualization.py --simulation --output-dir ./visualizations

# Generate and open in browser
python run_fault_tolerance_visualization.py --simulation --open-browser
