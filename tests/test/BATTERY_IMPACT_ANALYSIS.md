# Battery Impact Analysis Methodology

**Date: March 7, 2025**  
**Status: Initial Implementation**

## Overview

The Battery Impact Analysis Methodology provides a standardized approach for measuring and analyzing the impact of model inference on mobile device battery life. This methodology is designed for use with the IPFS Accelerate Python Framework, particularly for testing on Qualcomm and other mobile/edge hardware platforms.

## Motivation

As AI models are increasingly deployed on mobile and edge devices, understanding their impact on battery life becomes critical. This methodology addresses the need for:

- **Standardized Metrics**: Common metrics for comparing battery impact across models and hardware
- **Consistent Test Procedures**: Standardized procedures for reliable battery impact testing
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Holistic approach considering power, temperature, and performance
- **Integration with Benchmarking**: Integration with the existing benchmark framework

## Battery Impact Metrics

The methodology defines the following key metrics for battery impact analysis:

| Metric | Description | Unit | Collection Method |
|--------|-------------|------|------------------|
| Power Consumption (Avg) | Average power consumption during inference | Watts | OS power APIs |
| Power Consumption (Peak) | Peak power consumption during inference | Watts | OS power APIs |
| Energy per Inference | Energy consumed per inference | Joules | Calculated as power √ó time |
| Battery Impact (% per hour) | Battery percentage consumed per hour of continuous inference | % / hour | Extrapolated from power consumption |
| Temperature Increase | Device temperature increase during inference | ¬∞C | OS temperature APIs |
| Performance per Watt | Inference throughput divided by power consumption | inferences / watt | Calculated |
| Battery Life Impact | Estimated reduction in device battery life | % | Modeling based on usage patterns |

## Test Procedures

### 1. Continuous Inference Test

Measures battery impact during continuous model inference:

1. Record baseline power consumption and temperature
2. Start continuous inference loop
3. Measure power consumption and temperature every second
4. Record throughput (inferences per second)
5. Run for fixed duration (e.g., 10 minutes)
6. Calculate metrics

### 2. Periodic Inference Test

Measures battery impact with periodic inference and sleep intervals:

1. Record baseline power consumption and temperature
2. Run inference, then sleep for fixed interval (e.g., 10 seconds)
3. Repeat cycle for fixed duration (e.g., 10 minutes)
4. Measure power consumption and temperature throughout
5. Calculate metrics

### 3. Batch Size Impact Test

Analyzes how batch size affects power efficiency:

1. Run inference with various batch sizes (1, 2, 4, 8, 16)
2. Measure power consumption for each batch size
3. Calculate performance per watt
4. Determine optimal batch size for power efficiency

### 4. Quantization Impact Test

Measures how different quantization methods affect power consumption:

1. Run inference with different quantization methods (FP32, FP16, INT8, INT4)
2. Measure power consumption for each method
3. Calculate performance per watt
4. Determine optimal quantization for power efficiency

## Data Collection Guidelines

### Sampling Rate

- Power consumption: 1 Hz (once per second)
- Temperature: 1 Hz (once per second)
- Throughput: Continuous measurement
- Memory usage: 1 Hz (once per second)

### Test Duration

- Standard test duration: 10 minutes per test
- Minimum test duration: 5 minutes (for quick testing)
- Extended test duration: 30 minutes (for thermal stabilization)

### Repetitions

- Standard: 3 repetitions (for statistical significance)
- Quick test: 1 repetition (for rapid testing)
- Comprehensive test: 5 repetitions (for higher confidence)

### Device States

Tests should be conducted in various device states:

1. Plugged in (baseline)
2. Battery powered
3. Low power mode
4. High performance mode

## Device Types

The methodology supports testing on various device types:

1. **Flagship Smartphones** (e.g., Samsung Galaxy, Google Pixel)
2. **Mid-range Smartphones**
3. **Tablets**
4. **IoT/Edge Devices**

## Database Schema

The methodology extends the benchmark database with tables for battery impact data:

### Battery Impact Results Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS battery_impact_results (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    model_id INTEGER,
    hardware_id INTEGER,
    test_procedure VARCHAR,

    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (model_id) REFERENCES models(id),
    FOREIGN KEY (hardware_id) REFERENCES hardware_platforms(id)
)
```

### Battery Impact Time Series Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS battery_impact_time_series (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    result_id INTEGER,
    timestamp FLOAT,
    power_consumption FLOAT,
    temperature FLOAT,
    throughput FLOAT,
    memory_usage FLOAT,
    FOREIGN KEY (result_id) REFERENCES battery_impact_results(id)
)
```

## Reporting

The methodology defines standardized visualizations and reports:

1. **Metrics Table**: Summary table with all metrics for each model/quantization/device combination
2. **Power Profile Chart**: Line chart showing power consumption over time
3. **Temperature Profile Chart**: Line chart showing temperature over time
4. **Efficiency Comparison**: Bar chart comparing performance/watt across configurations
