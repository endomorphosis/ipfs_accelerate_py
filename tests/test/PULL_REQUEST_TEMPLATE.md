# Import Path Fixes for Reorganized Code

## Summary
This PR fixes import path issues in the IPFS Accelerate codebase after the March 2025 reorganization. It creates proper Python package structures for the `generators/` and `duckdb_api/` directories, updates import statements, and fixes syntax errors.

## Changes
- Added missing `__init__.py` files to complete package structure
- Updated import statements to use new package paths
- Fixed syntax errors in several files
- Updated documentation with correct import paths
- Created testing and utility scripts

## Testing
- Tested basic imports and script execution
- Fixed package import paths
- Verified syntax of key files
- Created a testing framework for import verification

## Documentation Updates
- Added `IMPORT_PATH_SETUP.md` with import path configuration instructions
- Updated `requirements.txt` with required dependencies
- Created guides for fixing remaining syntax errors

## Files Added
- `create_init_files.py` - Creates missing `__init__.py` files
- `test_package_imports.py` - Tests importing packages and modules
- `fix_syntax_errors.py` - Finds Python files with syntax errors
- `update_imports.py` - Updates import statements in Python files
- `IMPORT_PATH_SETUP.md` - Guide for setting up import paths
- `PATH_FIXES_README.md` - Overview of changes made
- `REORGANIZATION_TESTING_REPORT.md` - Detailed testing report
- `FIX_REMAINING_SYNTAX_ERRORS.md` - Guide to fix remaining syntax errors

## Known Issues
Some files still have syntax errors or import issues that need to be addressed:
- 13 files in the `duckdb_api` directory still have syntax errors
- Further testing is needed with actual usage scenarios
- CI/CD pipelines may need updates to use new paths

## Next Steps
1. Fix any remaining syntax errors using the provided guide
2. Test the package functionality more extensively
3. Update CI/CD pipelines to use the new paths
4. Update additional documentation references
