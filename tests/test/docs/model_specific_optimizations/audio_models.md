## Firefox WebGPU Performance Advantage

**Important:** Firefox shows approximately 20% better performance than Chrome for audio models on WebGPU. This advantage is due to Firefox's optimized compute shader implementation, particularly for the spectral transformations in audio models. For best web performance with audio models, Firefox is the recommended browser.

## Performance Optimization Techniques

### CUDA Optimization

CUDA provides the best overall performance for audio models.

#### Recommended Configurations

```python
# Whisper (ASR) on CUDA
platform = UnifiedWebPlatform(
    model_name="whisper-small",
    model_type="audio",
    platform="cuda",
    config={
        "precision": "fp16",
        "batch_size": 16,  # Adjust based on available memory
        "cuda_optimization_level": "highest",
        "optimize_spectrogram": True,  # Specialized audio preprocessing
        "feature_extraction_on_gpu": True
    }
)

# Wav2Vec2 on CUDA
platform = UnifiedWebPlatform(
    model_name="wav2vec2-base",
    model_type="audio",
    platform="cuda",
    config={
        "precision": "fp16",
        "batch_size": 24,
        "cuda_optimization_level": "highest",
        "feature_extraction_on_gpu": True,

        "cuda_optimization_level": "highest",
        "feature_extraction_on_gpu": True
    }
)
```

#### Memory Optimization

For audio models on CUDA:

- Perform feature extraction on GPU for end-to-end optimization
- Split long audio into chunks for processing
- Consider lower precision (int8) for larger models
- Use gradient checkpointing for training
- For Whisper, use beam search with low beam width (2-3)

### ROCm (AMD) Optimization

ROCm provides good performance for audio models but typically lags behind CUDA.

#### Recommended Configurations

```python
# Whisper on ROCm
platform = UnifiedWebPlatform(
    model_name="whisper-small",
    model_type="audio",
    platform="rocm",
    config={
        "precision": "fp16",
        "batch_size": 8,  # Start with smaller batch size than CUDA
        "rocm_optimization_level": "high",
        "optimize_spectrogram": True,
        "feature_extraction_on_gpu": True
    }
)

# Wav2Vec2 on ROCm
platform = UnifiedWebPlatform(
    model_name="wav2vec2-base",
    model_type="audio",
    platform="rocm",
    config={
