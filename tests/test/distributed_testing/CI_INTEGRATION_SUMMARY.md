## Local CI Testing

The `run_hardware_monitoring_ci_tests.sh` script allows developers to test changes locally before pushing to GitHub:

```bash
# Run standard tests
./run_hardware_monitoring_ci_tests.sh

# Run full tests
./run_hardware_monitoring_ci_tests.sh --mode full

# Run with CI integration tests
./run_hardware_monitoring_ci_tests.sh --mode full --ci-integration

# Run macOS-specific tests (on macOS only)
./run_hardware_monitoring_ci_tests.sh --mode full --macos
```

This script generates the same test reports and database files as the GitHub Actions workflows, facilitating local validation of changes.
