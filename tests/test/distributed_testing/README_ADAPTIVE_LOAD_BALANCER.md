# Advanced Adaptive Load Balancer

The Advanced Adaptive Load Balancer is a key component of the Distributed Testing Framework that intelligently redistributes tasks across worker nodes to optimize resource utilization and system performance. It implements sophisticated strategies that go beyond simple utilization-based balancing to provide a self-tuning, proactive system that adapts to changing workloads and heterogeneous hardware environments.

## Overview

Traditional load balancers typically use fixed thresholds to determine when to migrate tasks from overloaded to underloaded workers. While effective in stable environments, this approach has limitations:

1. **Static thresholds** don't adapt to overall system load conditions
2. **Simple migration policies** don't consider the cost vs. benefit of migration
3. **Reactive approach** only responds after imbalance occurs
4. **Hardware homogeneity assumption** doesn't account for specialized capabilities
5. **Limited resource considerations** focus solely on CPU/memory utilization

The Advanced Adaptive Load Balancer addresses these limitations with a comprehensive, data-driven approach that continuously learns and adapts to optimize system performance, resource utilization, and energy efficiency.

## Key Features

### 1. Dynamic Threshold Adjustment

The system dynamically adjusts utilization thresholds based on overall system load and trends, allowing it to adapt to changing conditions:

- **Load-Aware Thresholds**: Thresholds are automatically adjusted based on system-wide load patterns
- **Trend Analysis**: Uses linear regression to detect increasing, decreasing, or stable system load trends
- **Workload History**: Maintains system load history for intelligent decision making
- **Adaptive Response**: More aggressive balancing during high load, more conservative during low load
- **Self-Tuning**: Learns from historical data to optimize threshold settings

### 2. Cost-Benefit Analysis for Migrations

Each potential task migration is evaluated with a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis:

- **Migration Cost Calculation**: Considers task type, running time, priority, and state size
- **Benefit Calculation**: Evaluates utilization improvements, hardware match, and resource margins
- **Net Benefit Evaluation**: Only migrations with positive net benefit are performed
- **Historical Success Tracking**: Learns from past migration outcomes to improve future decisions
- **Exponential Moving Average**: Updates cost and success metrics with weighted historical data

### 3. Predictive Load Balancing

The system can predict future load imbalances and act proactively before problems occur:

- **Workload Trend Prediction**: Uses historical data to predict future system and worker loads
- **Proactive Migration**: Initiates migrations based on predicted future imbalances
- **Confidence Scoring**: Includes confidence levels for predictions to avoid unnecessary migrations
- **Accuracy Tracking**: Evaluates prediction accuracy to improve future predictions
- **Imbalance Forecasting**: Predicts not just load, but potential imbalance between workers

### 4. Resource Efficiency Considerations

The load balancer considers energy efficiency and optimal resource utilization:

- **Hardware Profiles**: Maintains profiles of different hardware types with efficiency metrics
- **Energy Efficiency Scoring**: Considers power efficiency in migration decisions
- **Thermal Management**: Accounts for thermal characteristics of different hardware
- **Power-Aware Task Routing**: Routes power-efficient tasks to power-efficient hardware
- **GPU Memory Optimization**: Special handling for GPU memory to avoid fragmentation

### 5. Hardware-Specific Balancing Strategies

Implements tailored strategies for different hardware types:

- **Hardware Capability Awareness**: Different strategies for CPU, CUDA, ROCm, etc.
- **Custom Profiles**: Customized balancing strategies based on specific hardware capabilities
- **CUDA Compute Capability**: Special handling for different CUDA compute capabilities
- **Worker Specialization**: Recognizes which workers excel at specific hardware tasks
- **Heterogeneous Environment Support**: Balances workloads across heterogeneous hardware

- Simulates varying workloads on different workers
- Dynamically adds workers over time
- Logs the system status including load balancing metrics

## Performance Metrics and Monitoring

The Advanced Adaptive Load Balancer stores detailed metrics in the database for analysis, visualization, and continuous improvement.

### Data Model

The load balancer metrics are stored in a dedicated DuckDB table with the following schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE load_balancer_metrics (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP,
    system_load FLOAT,              -- Average system-wide utilization (0.0-1.0)
    threshold_high FLOAT,           -- Current high threshold value
    threshold_low FLOAT,            -- Current low threshold value
    imbalance_score FLOAT,          -- Current system imbalance score (0.0-1.0)
    migrations_initiated INTEGER,   -- Number of migrations initiated in this interval
    migrations_successful INTEGER,  -- Number of migrations successfully completed
    prediction_accuracy FLOAT,      -- Accuracy of previous load predictions (0.0-1.0)
    metrics JSON                    -- Additional detailed metrics in JSON format
)
```

The `metrics` JSON field contains additional structured data including:

```json
{
  "worker_count": 5,
  "active_migrations": 2,
  "thresholds": {
    "high": 0.82,
    "low": 0.24,
    "initial_high": 0.85,
    "initial_low": 0.20
  },
  "migrations": {
    "initiated": 3,
    "successful": 2,
    "success_rate": 0.67
  },
  "features": {
    "dynamic_thresholds": true,
    "predictive_balancing": true,
    "cost_benefit_analysis": true,
    "hardware_specific": true,
    "resource_efficiency": true
  },
  "prediction": {
    "current_load": 0.68,
    "predicted_load": 0.74,
    "confidence": 0.85,
    "window_minutes": 3
  }
}
```

### Key Metrics

The Advanced Adaptive Load Balancer tracks these essential metrics:

- **System Load Metrics**: Overall system utilization and imbalance scores
- **Threshold Adjustments**: Changes to high and low thresholds over time
- **Migration Metrics**: Success rates, costs, and benefits of migrations
- **Prediction Accuracy**: Accuracy of load predictions over time
- **Decision Logs**: Records of migration decisions with reasoning
- **Resource Efficiency**: Energy and thermal efficiency metrics
- **Hardware Utilization**: Specialized metrics for different hardware types
- **Trend Analysis**: Load trend direction and magnitude
- **Adaptation Rate**: How quickly the system adapts to changing conditions

These metrics can be queried from the database:

```sql
-- Get recent threshold adjustments
SELECT timestamp, threshold_high, threshold_low, system_load
FROM load_balancer_metrics
ORDER BY timestamp DESC
LIMIT 50;

-- Analyze migration success rates
SELECT
    DATE(timestamp) as date,
    SUM(migrations_initiated) as total_migrations,
    SUM(migrations_successful) as successful_migrations,
    ROUND(SUM(migrations_successful) * 100.0 / SUM(migrations_initiated), 1) as success_rate
FROM load_balancer_metrics
GROUP BY DATE(timestamp)
ORDER BY date DESC;

-- Check prediction accuracy over time
SELECT
    timestamp,
    prediction_accuracy,
    system_load,
    imbalance_score
FROM load_balancer_metrics
WHERE prediction_accuracy IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY timestamp DESC
LIMIT 100;
```

## Hardware Profiles

The system maintains profiles for different hardware types to optimize balancing decisions:

| Hardware Type | Performance Weight | Energy Efficiency | Thermal Efficiency | Notes |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------------------|-------|
| CPU | 1.0 | 0.7 | 0.8 | Baseline performance |
| CUDA | 3.0 | 0.5 | 0.4 | High performance, lower efficiency |
| ROCm | 2.8 | 0.5 | 0.4 | Similar to CUDA |
| MPS | 2.5 | 0.6 | 0.6 | Apple Silicon GPU |
| OpenVINO | 1.8 | 0.8 | 0.7 | Intel optimization |
| QNN | 1.4 | 0.9 | 0.9 | Qualcomm Neural Networks - high efficiency |
| WebNN | 1.0 | 0.7 | 0.8 | Browser neural network API |
| WebGPU | 1.2 | 0.6 | 0.7 | Browser GPU API |

The system dynamically updates these profiles based on observed performance from actual workers.

## Integration with Other Components

The Advanced Adaptive Load Balancer integrates with other framework components through well-defined interfaces and coordination mechanisms:

### Coordinator Integration

The load balancer is integrated into the coordinator (`coordinator.py`) through these key integration points:

```python
# Initialization in coordinator
if enable_load_balancer:
    self.load_balancer = AdaptiveLoadBalancer(
        self,
        enable_dynamic_thresholds=True,
        enable_predictive_balancing=True,
        enable_cost_benefit_analysis=True,
        enable_hardware_specific_strategies=True,
        enable_resource_efficiency=True
    )
    logger.info("Adaptive load balancer initialized")

# Starting the load balancer as a background task
if self.load_balancer:
    self.load_balancer_task = asyncio.create_task(
        self.load_balancer.start_balancing()
    )
    logger.info("Load balancer started")
```

### Component Integration

The Advanced Adaptive Load Balancer integrates with other framework components:

- **Task Scheduler Integration**:
  - Uses the scheduler's worker selection logic for migration targets
  - Respects task affinity and worker specialization data
  - Updates the scheduler with migration outcomes

- **Health Monitor Integration**:
  - Coordinates with health monitoring to avoid migrating to unhealthy workers
  - Checks worker health status before selecting migration targets
  - Considers worker health history in migration decisions

- **Security Module Integration**:
  - All API calls respect the authentication and authorization requirements
  - Ensures secure communication during migration operations

- **Database Integration**:
  - Creates and uses the load_balancer_metrics table
  - Stores all metrics and decisions for analysis
  - Uses database queries to track historical performance

- **Auto Recovery Integration**:
  - Coordinates with auto recovery to handle task migrations during recovery
  - Avoids conflicting migrations during recovery operations
  - Provides migration capabilities for recovery procedures

### API Integration

The load balancer exposes an internal API for other components to interact with:

```python
# Get load balancer statistics
def get_load_balancer_stats() -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Get statistics about the load balancer."""
    
# Handle task cancellation for migration
async def handle_task_cancelled_for_migration(task_id: str, source_worker_id: str):
    """Handle task cancellation for migration."""
    
# Update worker performance metrics
async def update_worker_performance(worker_id: str, metrics: Dict[str, Any]):
    """Update worker performance metrics externally."""
```

### Event Flow for Task Migration

The task migration process involves coordination between multiple components:

1. **Load Balancer**: Detects imbalance and selects task to migrate
2. **Coordinator**: Receives migration request
3. **Source Worker**: Receives task cancellation request
4. **Task**: State is saved and task is cancelled on source worker
5. **Load Balancer**: Handles task cancellation notification
6. **Task Scheduler**: Assigns task to target worker
7. **Target Worker**: Receives and executes the migrated task
8. **Database**: Task status is updated throughout the process

This coordinated process ensures that tasks are migrated reliably and efficiently, with proper state management and error handling throughout.

## Advanced Features

### Dynamic System-Wide Load Adaptation

The system adapts its thresholds and strategies based on overall system load:

- During high load (>75% average utilization):
  - Lower the high threshold to trigger more migrations
  - Raise the low threshold to better balance workloads
  - More aggressive migration policy

- During low load (<30% average utilization):
  - Raise the high threshold to avoid unnecessary migrations
  - Lower the low threshold to consolidate workloads
  - More conservative migration policy

### Algorithm and Decision Flow

The advanced load balancing algorithm follows this decision flow:

```
1. COLLECT performance metrics from all workers
   - CPU, memory, GPU utilization
   - Running tasks count and types
   - Network, disk I/O metrics
   - Temperature and power metrics (if available)

2. UPDATE system load history with new data
   - Calculate system-wide average utilization
   - Calculate utilization standard deviation
   - Calculate imbalance score (max-min utilization)
   - Store in system_load_history

3. IF enable_dynamic_thresholds is TRUE:
   - Analyze system load trend (increasing/decreasing/stable)
   - Calculate adjustment factors based on trend and load level
   - Update utilization_threshold_high and utilization_threshold_low
   - Ensure minimum separation between thresholds

4. IF enable_predictive_balancing is TRUE:
   - Use linear regression on recent load history
   - Predict future system-wide load
   - Predict worker-specific future loads
   - Calculate confidence score for predictions
   - Calculate predicted imbalance score

5. DETECT load imbalance:
   - Find workers with highest and lowest utilization
   - Calculate current imbalance (max_util - min_util)
   - Check if max_util > threshold_high AND min_util < threshold_low
     AND imbalance > imbalance_threshold
   - ALTERNATIVELY, if using predictive balancing:
     Check if predicted_max_util > threshold_high AND
     predicted_min_util < threshold_low AND
     predicted_imbalance > imbalance_threshold

6. IF imbalance detected:
   a. For each overloaded worker:
      i. Find tasks that can be migrated
      ii. For each migratable task:
          - For each underloaded worker:
              * IF worker can handle task:
                  + Calculate migration cost
                  + Calculate migration benefit
                  + Calculate net_benefit = benefit - cost
                  + If net_benefit > 0, add to migration candidates
      iii. Sort migration candidates by net_benefit (highest first)
      iv. Process candidates until max_simultaneous_migrations reached

7. CLEANUP completed migrations
   - Process completed migrations
   - Update success rates and historical metrics
   - Timeout stale migrations

8. RECORD metrics in database
   - System load metrics
   - Threshold values
   - Migration statistics
   - Prediction accuracy
```

#### Dynamic Threshold Adjustment Algorithm

```python
# Pseudocode for dynamic threshold adjustment
def update_dynamic_thresholds():
    # Get recent system load data
    recent_loads = system_load_history[-5:]
    avg_system_load = average(recent_loads)
    
    # Calculate load trend using linear regression
    x = list(range(len(trend_records)))
    y = [record.avg_utilization for record in trend_records]
    trend_slope = calculate_linear_regression_slope(x, y)
    
    # Determine adjustment factors
    if trend_slope > 0.01:  # Load increasing
        adjustment_factor = threshold_adjustment_rate * 1.5
        direction = "increasing"
    elif trend_slope < -0.01:  # Load decreasing
        adjustment_factor = threshold_adjustment_rate * 0.5
        direction = "decreasing"
    else:  # Load stable
        adjustment_factor = threshold_adjustment_rate
        direction = "stable"
    
    # Adjust based on current load
    if avg_system_load > 0.75:  # High load
        high_adjust = -adjustment_factor * 1.2  # Lower high threshold
        low_adjust = adjustment_factor * 0.8    # Raise low threshold
    elif avg_system_load < 0.3:  # Low load
        high_adjust = adjustment_factor * 0.8   # Raise high threshold
        low_adjust = -adjustment_factor * 1.2   # Lower low threshold
    else:  # Normal load
        high_adjust = -adjustment_factor if avg_system_load > 0.5 else adjustment_factor
        low_adjust = adjustment_factor if avg_system_load > 0.5 else -adjustment_factor
    
    # Apply adjustments within boundaries
    new_high = max(0.6, min(0.95, utilization_threshold_high + high_adjust))
    new_low = max(0.1, min(0.4, utilization_threshold_low + low_adjust))
    
    # Ensure minimum separation
    min_separation = 0.3
    if new_high - new_low < min_separation:
        if high_adjust < low_adjust:
            new_high = new_low + min_separation
        else:
            new_low = new_high - min_separation
    
    # Update thresholds
    utilization_threshold_high = new_high
    utilization_threshold_low = new_low
```

### Cost-Benefit Analysis

Each potential migration is evaluated with a sophisticated cost-benefit analysis:

**Cost Factors**:
- Task running time (longer-running tasks are more costly to migrate)
- Task state size (tasks with large state are more costly to migrate)
- Task priority (higher priority tasks have higher migration costs)
- Historical migration costs for similar tasks

**Benefit Factors**:
- Worker utilization difference (higher difference = higher benefit)
- Hardware capability match (better hardware match = higher benefit)
- Memory margin improvement (more memory headroom = higher benefit)
- Energy efficiency improvement (more efficient hardware = higher benefit)
- Historical worker success with similar tasks

**Decision Process**:
1. Calculate migration cost score (0.0-10.0 scale)
2. Calculate migration benefit score (0.0+ scale)
3. Calculate net benefit (benefit - cost)
4. Only proceed if net benefit > 0
5. Prioritize migrations with highest net benefit

### Predictive Load Balancing

The system can predict future load imbalances and act proactively:

**Prediction Method**:
- Uses linear regression on recent system load history
- Calculates per-worker load trends
- Predicts load for each worker after prediction_window minutes
- Calculates predicted imbalance score
- Assigns confidence level to predictions based on variance

**Proactive Balancing**:
- Triggers migrations based on predicted future imbalances
- Only acts on high-confidence predictions (>70%)
- Requires more substantial predicted imbalance than for current imbalance
- Tracks prediction accuracy to improve future predictions
