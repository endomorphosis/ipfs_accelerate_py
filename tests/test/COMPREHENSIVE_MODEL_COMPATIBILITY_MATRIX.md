# Comprehensive Model Compatibility Matrix

## Overview

This document provides a complete compatibility matrix for all 300+ HuggingFace model classes supported by the framework. The matrix shows cross-platform support status for each model class across all supported hardware platforms (CUDA, ROCm, MPS, OpenVINO, Qualcomm, WebNN, WebGPU).

**Note:** This file is automatically generated from the DuckDB database and should not be manually edited. The matrix is updated automatically as part of the CI/CD pipeline to reflect the latest test and benchmark results.

## Matrix Generation

The matrix is generated using a database query script that extracts compatibility information from the DuckDB benchmark database. The script queries the following tables:

- `cross_platform_compatibility`: Primary source for hardware support status
- `performance_comparison`: Source for performance metrics
- `model_conversion_metrics`: Source for quantization support
- `hardware_capabilities`: Source for hardware-specific capabilities

The matrix is regenerated according to the following schedule:
- Daily: Full matrix update at 00:00 UTC
- On-demand: When running the matrix generation script manually
- Post-benchmark: After completing benchmark runs with new models or hardware

## Matrix Reading Guide

### Compatibility Levels

The matrix uses the following indicators for compatibility status:

| Symbol | Level | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| ✅ | Full | Full support with optimal performance |
| ⚠️ | Limited | Works with limitations or reduced performance |
| 🔄 | Experimental | Implementation exists but not fully tested |
| ❌ | Not Supported | Implementation does not exist or does not work |
| 🔜 | Planned | Support planned in future releases |

### Performance Indicators

Where available, performance metrics are included as follows:

- **Throughput**: Items processed per second (higher is better)
- **Latency**: Processing time in milliseconds (lower is better)
- **Memory**: Peak memory usage in MB (lower is better)
- **Power**: Power consumption in watts (lower is better, mobile/edge only)

## Usage Examples

### Filtering by Hardware Platform

To view all models that work well on Qualcomm hardware:

```bash
python duckdb_api/core/duckdb_api/core/benchmark_db_query.py --hardware qualcomm --compatibility-level high --format markdown
```

### Filtering by Model Type

To view all vision models with their compatibility:

```bash
python duckdb_api/core/duckdb_api/core/benchmark_db_query.py --model-type vision --format markdown
```

### Generating Performance Comparison

To compare performance across hardware for a specific model:

```bash
python duckdb_api/core/duckdb_api/core/benchmark_db_query.py --model bert-base-uncased --metric throughput --compare-hardware
```

## Implementation Details

The matrix generation script is implemented in `generate_compatibility_matrix.py`. The script:

1. Connects to the DuckDB database
2. Runs SQL queries to extract compatibility data
3. Processes the data to generate markdown tables
4. Writes the results to this file

The implementation includes:
- Support for filtering by model type, hardware platform, and compatibility level
- Dynamic generation of performance comparisons
- Visual indicators for compatibility status
- Detailed notes on implementation status and limitations

## Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements to the matrix generation system include:
- Interactive HTML version with filtering and sorting capabilities
- Integration with the dashboard for visual exploration
- Delta reports showing compatibility changes over time
- Performance trend analysis across hardware platforms
- Automatic recommendation system for optimal hardware selection
