python3 tests/test_workflow_simple.py
```

**What it tests:**

- HuggingFace model search API works
- Model download API works
- Downloaded models appear in stats

---

### 2. `test_huggingface_workflow.py` - Full E2E Playwright Test
Comprehensive end-to-end test that uses Playwright to test the complete UI workflow.

**Prerequisites:**
```bash
pip install playwright
playwright install chromium
```

**Usage:**
```bash
# The test will start the server automatically
python3 tests/test_huggingface_workflow.py
```

**What it tests:**
1. Starts MCP server with `ipfs-accelerate mcp start`

3. Navigates to "üîç HF Search" tab
4. Searches for "bert" model
5. Clicks Download button
6. Navigates to "üìö Model Browser" tab

## Complete Workflow Test

To verify the entire workflow works:

1. **Start the MCP server:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m ipfs_accelerate_py.mcp_dashboard
   ```
   Server will be available at: http://127.0.0.1:8899/mcp

2. **Run the simple API test:**
   ```bash
   python3 tests/test_workflow_simple.py
   ```

3. **Run the full Playwright E2E test:**
   ```bash
   python3 tests/test_huggingface_workflow.py
   ```

## Manual Testing

You can also test manually:

1. Open http://127.0.0.1:8899/mcp in your browser
2. Click the "üîç HF Search" tab
3. Enter "bert" in the search box
4. Click "üîç Search HF Hub"
5. Click "‚¨áÔ∏è Download" on any bert model
6. Switch to "üìö Model Browser" tab
7. Verify the model appears in the list

## Troubleshooting

### Server won't start
- Check if port 8899 is available
- Check for errors in console output

### Search returns no results
- Check API endpoint in browser console
- Verify `/api/mcp/models/search` is accessible

### Download fails
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify `/api/mcp/models/download` endpoint works
- Check server logs for backend errors

### Playwright tests fail
- Ensure Playwright is installed: `pip install playwright`
- Install browser: `playwright install chromium`
- Check screenshots in test_screenshots_workflow/ for debugging
