# IPFS Accelerate MCP Server Test Results

## Overview

This report summarizes the results of testing the IPFS Accelerate MCP server.

## Server Information

- **URL**: http://localhost:8002
- **Server Name**: ipfs-accelerate-mcp
- **Version**: 0.1.0
- **MCP Version**: 0.1.0

## Manifest and Tool Registration

The server's manifest only shows 1 registered tool:
- get_hardware_info

However, during the server startup, logs indicate registration of additional tools:
- get_hardware_info
- ipfs_add_file
- ipfs_node_info
- model_inference
- list_models

This indicates a discrepancy between what's registered with MCP and what appears in the manifest.

## Tool Testing Results

| Tool | Working | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| get_hardware_info | ✅ | Returns detailed system and accelerator info |
| ipfs_add_file | ✅ | Works despite not being in manifest |
| ipfs_node_info | ✅ | Works despite not being in manifest |
| model_inference | ❌ | Returns "Tool not found" error |
| list_models | ❌ | Returns "Tool not found" error |

## Analysis

There appears to be an issue with the MCP server's tool registration mechanism. While the logs show tools being registered, not all of them are actually available through the MCP manifest or accessible via API calls.

The `get_hardware_info`, `ipfs_add_file`, and `ipfs_node_info` tools work correctly and return expected responses. However, `model_inference` and `list_models` are not accessible, despite logs indicating they were registered.

This suggests that there might be an issue with the tool registration process, possibly related to:
1. Namespace conflicts during registration
2. Overriding of tools during server initialization
3. Incorrect implementation of the registration methods

## Expected Coverage vs. Actual Coverage

According to the documentation, the MCP server should expose up to 19 tools across different categories, but the current implementation only has 3 working tools.

## Recommendations

1. Review the tool registration mechanism in the MCP server implementation
2. Check for potential namespace conflicts or overrides
3. Implement a more consistent registration process
4. Create a unified tool registry that maintains all tool registrations
5. Add better logging and validation to ensure tools are properly registered

## Conclusion

The IPFS Accelerate MCP server is partially functional, with 3 out of 19 expected tools working correctly. Further development is needed to expose all the functionality of the ipfs_accelerate_py package through the MCP server.
