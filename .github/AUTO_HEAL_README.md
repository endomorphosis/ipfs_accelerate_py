# üîß GitHub Actions Auto-Healing System

## Overview

The Auto-Healing System is an automated workflow failure detection and remediation system that **automatically diagnoses and fixes** common GitHub Actions workflow failures. It can apply automated fixes for many common issues and create pull requests without manual intervention.

## üéØ Features

- **Automatic Failure Detection**: Monitors all GitHub Actions workflows for failures
- **Intelligent Analysis**: Analyzes failure logs to identify root causes with high confidence
- **Automated Fixes**: Automatically fixes common issues (dependencies, timeouts, syntax, permissions)
- **Issue Tracking**: Creates tracking issues for every failure
- **Automatic Pull Request Generation**: Creates PRs with automated fixes when possible
- **Manual Intervention Support**: Provides detailed guidance when automatic fixes aren't possible
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Maintains detailed logs and reports for audit
- **Configurable Behavior**: Extensive configuration options for customization

```

## üìã Workflow Lifecycle

### 1. Failure Detection

When any GitHub Actions workflow fails:
- The `workflow_run` event triggers the auto-heal workflow
- Only workflows with `conclusion: failure` are processed

### 2. Failure Analysis

The system:
- Fetches workflow run details via GitHub API
- Identifies all failed jobs and steps
- Extracts relevant error logs
- Creates a structured analysis JSON file
- Categorizes the failure type with confidence score

### 3. Issue Creation

A tracking issue is automatically created with:
- Workflow name and run ID
- Failed job details
- Error logs and context
- Links to the failed run
- Auto-heal label for tracking
- Detailed analysis and root cause

### 4. Automated Fix Application

The system attempts to automatically fix common issues:

**Dependency Issues** (95% confidence)
- Detects missing Python/Node modules
- Adds them to requirements.txt or package.json
- Commits and pushes the fix

**Timeout Issues** (90% confidence)
- Identifies timeout failures
- Increases timeout values appropriately
- Updates workflow files

**Syntax Issues** (85% confidence)
- Detects YAML syntax errors
- Fixes common formatting issues
- Cleans up trailing whitespace

**Permission Issues** (85% confidence)
- Identifies permission errors
- Adds necessary permission blocks
- Updates workflow configuration

**Docker Issues** (80% confidence)
- Detects Dockerfile syntax errors
- Fixes common Docker build issues
- Updates Docker configuration

### 5. Pull Request Creation

If automated fixes were applied, the system:
- Commits the changes to the auto-heal branch
- Pushes the branch to remote
- Creates a pull request automatically
- Links the PR to the tracking issue
- Applies appropriate labels
- Provides detailed fix summary

### 6. Manual Intervention (if needed)

If automatic fixes aren't possible:
- Posts detailed instructions to the issue
- Provides the prepared branch for manual fixes
- Includes complete analysis and suggestions
- Optionally notifies GitHub Copilot Workspace for assistance

### 7. Pull Request Review

The PR (whether automated or manual):
- Contains the proposed fixes
- Contains the proposed fixes
- Links to the tracking issue
- Includes detailed explanation of changes
- Runs CI/CD tests to validate the fix

### 8. Review and Merge

The PR is:
- Reviewed by human developers
- Tested automatically via CI/CD
- Merged if tests pass and changes are approved
- Closes the tracking issue when merged

## üîß Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

1. **GitHub Repository Settings**
   - Enable GitHub Actions
   - GitHub Copilot (optional - only needed for manual intervention support)
   - Set up branch protection rules (recommended)

2. **Required Permissions**
   - The workflow needs these permissions:
     ```yaml
     permissions:
       contents: write
       pull-requests: write
       issues: write
       actions: read
     ```

### Installation

1. **Add the Auto-Heal Workflow**
   
   The auto-heal workflow is located at:
   ```
   .github/workflows/auto-heal-failures.yml
   ```

2. **Configure Settings**
   
   Edit `.github/auto-heal-config.yml` to customize:
   - Which workflows to monitor
   - Notification preferences
   - Copilot settings
   - Branch naming conventions
   - PR templates

3. **Set Up GitHub Secrets** (Optional)
   
   If using custom GitHub tokens:
   ```bash
   # Add to repository secrets
   GITHUB_TOKEN: <your-token>  # Default token usually works
   ```

4. **Test the System**
   
   Create a test workflow that intentionally fails:
   ```yaml
   name: Test Auto-Heal
   on: [workflow_dispatch]
   jobs:
     test-fail:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - run: exit 1  # Intentional failure
   ```
   
   Run it manually and watch the auto-heal system activate!
