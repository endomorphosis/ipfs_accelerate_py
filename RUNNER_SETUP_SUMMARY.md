- **Existing Setup Guide**: `/home/barberb/ipfs_accelerate_py/docs/SELF_HOSTED_RUNNER_SETUP.md`

### 🔧 System Status

Your system is **ready** for GitHub Actions runner installation:

- ✅ **Operating System**: Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS (x86_64)
- ✅ **Required Tools**: curl, wget, git, tar (all installed)
- ✅ **Docker**: Installed and accessible (version 27.5.1)
- ✅ **Python**: Python 3.12.3 with pip
- ✅ **Resources**: 56 CPU cores, 125GB RAM, 650GB disk space
- ✅ **No Existing Runners**: Clean installation possible

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Install Primary Runner
```bash
cd /home/barberb/ipfs_accelerate_py

# Get your token from GitHub repository settings
./scripts/setup-github-runner.sh --token YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN --install-deps
```

### Option 2: Install Backup Runner Only
```bash
cd /home/barberb/ipfs_accelerate_py

# If you already have a primary runner elsewhere
./scripts/setup-backup-runner.sh YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN
```

## 🔑 Getting Your GitHub Token

1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/endomorphosis/ipfs_accelerate_py
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Actions** → **Runners**
3. Click **New self-hosted runner**
4. Select **Linux** and **x64**
5. Copy the token from the `./config.sh` command

## 📊 What the Scripts Do

### Primary Runner Installation
- Downloads and configures GitHub Actions runner
- Sets up systemd service for automatic startup
- Configures appropriate labels based on hardware
- Sets up monitoring and health checks
- Installs system dependencies (if requested)

### Backup Runner Installation  
- Creates additional runner in separate directory
- Uses different service name (`github-actions-runner-backup`)
- Automatically detects and matches system capabilities
- Adds "backup" label for identification

### System Configuration
Your runners will be configured with these labels:
- `self-hosted` - Self-hosted runner
- `linux` - Linux operating system  
- `x64` - x86_64 architecture
- `docker` - Docker support available
- `cpu-only` - No GPU detected (NVIDIA drivers have issues)

## 🔍 Monitoring and Management

After installation, you can:

```bash
# Check runner status
sudo systemctl status github-actions-runner
sudo systemctl status github-actions-runner-backup

# View runner logs
sudo journalctl -u github-actions-runner -f

# Health checks
~/actions-runner/health-check.sh
~/actions-runner-backup/health-check.sh backup

# System monitoring
./scripts/monitor-runners.sh
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

1. **NVIDIA GPU Issues**: Detected but drivers not working properly
   - Solution: GPU will be ignored, runners configured for CPU-only

2. **Permission Issues**: 
   - Docker: User already in docker group ✅
   - Sudo: Required for service creation

3. **Network Issues**: Ensure outbound HTTPS access to GitHub

## 📁 File Locations After Installation

- **Primary Runner**: `~/actions-runner/`
- **Backup Runner**: `~/actions-runner-backup/`  
- **Service Configs**: `/etc/systemd/system/github-actions-runner*.service`
- **Logs**: `/var/log/github-actions/`
- **Health Checks**: `~/actions-runner*/health-check.sh`

## 🔒 Security Notes

- Runners will have access to repository code and secrets
- Services run under your user account
- Runners are configured with appropriate isolation
- Regular monitoring scripts help detect issues

## ✅ Verification

After installation:
1. Runners appear in GitHub repository settings
2. Services show as active: `sudo systemctl status github-actions-runner*`
3. Health checks pass: `~/actions-runner/health-check.sh`
4. Runners accept and execute jobs from your workflows
